events.&nbsp.\n<\/li>\n<li>We may share information about you for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please note that the third parties may independently collect data about you, through cookies, clicks on links, or other means when you visit or view ads on the Sites.<\/p>\n<p>We work closely with our affiliated companies, such as our parent companies and their affiliated entities and subsidiaries under common ownership or control.\nWe share your information with our affiliates that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.\nIn some cases, these affiliates may operate portions of the Sites or aspects of related services, or market or sell offerings to you.\nIn other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell digital content or other offering jointly with these affiliates.<\/p> 5.\nYour choices, cookies and other tracking technologies and “do not track” signals Deactivating your account <p>If the Sites functionality permits, you can deactivate your account at any time by visiting the preferences page for your profile or delete any content you provide from the Sites, though we may retain a copy of any deactivated accounts or deleted content for compliance purposes.\nWhen you deactivate your account, your user profile will be disabled, but your public comments will remain on the Sites.\nWe have no responsibility, other than as may be required by applicable law, to take down, remove, or edit any of your public activities or any submissions that are a result of your public activities.\nFor more information, please review our Terms of Use.<\/p> Cookies and other tracking technologies <p>Some information that is collected about you is collected automatically through cookies and other tracking technologies.\nCookies are small amounts of information stored in files within your computer's browser.\nWe may use these technologies to collect information about your activity, browser and device, and to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our third party partners, such as advertising.\nMost web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but, if you prefer, you can usually remove or reject cookies through the settings on your browser or device.\nHowever, please note that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.\nPlease see our Cookie Policy for more information about how we use cookies and your choices.\n<\/p> “Do not track” signals <p>The “do not track” (or “DNT”) concept has been promoted by regulatory authorities for the internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.\nVarious web browsers offer a DNT option that sends a signal to websites visited by the user’s browser about the user's DNT preference.\nYou can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's “preferences” or similar settings.\nAs of the time of the posting of this Privacy Policy, there is no internet industry DNT technology standard.\nWe take privacy and security seriously.\nWith regard to DNT, the Sites do not currently respond to DNT signals in browsers because, as mentioned above, no DNT standard has been adopted.\nHowever, as explained above, you do have choices regarding how your browser handles cookies and other similar technologies.\n<\/p> Third Party Online Advertising <p>Some of the advertisements you see on the Sites are from third parties, such as advertising agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and audience segment providers.\nThese third parties may collect information about you and your online activities, either on the Sites or on other websites, through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to understand your interests and tailor certain advertisements to your interests.<\/p>\n<p>The Company does not have control over, or access to the information these non-affiliated third parties may collect.\nSuch third parties' information practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on the Sites, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about how we use cookies and your choices, please see our Cookie Policy.\n<\/p> 6.\nAccess <p>If you choose to share personal information with us, you may update or amend this information by contacting us at legal@mail.myanimelist.net.\nPlease include in your email

their personal information, as we describe further below.<\/p>\n<p>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights:<\/p>\n<p>As a California resident, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see below

context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with

with us.<\/li>\n<li>Comply with a legal obligation.<\/li>\n<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided

verifiable consumer request to us by email at: legal@mail.myanimelist.net or by regular mail at: MyAnimeList, Attn: Privacy Officer, 1-1-1 Hitotsubashi Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-0003 Japan.<\/p>\n<p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.\nYou may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.\nYou may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.\nThe verifiable consumer request must (a) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and (b) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.\nMaking a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\nWe will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.<\/p>\n<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receipt, but if we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\nAny disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.\nIf we cannot comply with the request, our response will explain the reasons we cannot comply.\nFor data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to easily transfer the information from one entity to another entity.\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.<\/p>\n<p>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights:<\/p>\n<p>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”).\nWe do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is 13 to 15 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.\nConsumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you can click on the “Do not sell my data” link available on our homepage and other pages of this website.\nYou will then have the option of clicking on a toggle button or checking a box and confirming your choice to opt-out.\nOnce you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.\nHowever, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by clicking on the “Do not sell my data” link again and unchecking the box or clicking on the toggle button again and confirming your choice to opt back in.<\/p> Non-Discrimination <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nUnless permitted by the CCPA, we will not do any of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.<\/li>\n<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.\nAny CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.\nParticipation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.<\/p> Other California Privacy Rights <p>If you are a California resident, under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) you may request further information about our practices related to disclosing your personal information to certain third parties and/or opt-out of our sharing of your personal information with unaffiliated third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.\nPlease send

establish or exercise our rights, to comply with our legal obligations and/or to defend against legal actions or claims.\n<\/li>\n<li>We may share information about you to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety or other rights and interests of any person, violations of the Sites' Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.\n<\/li>\n<li>If you choose to engage in public activities on the site, such as posting comments on community message boards, any information you submit can be read, collected, or used by others.\nPlease exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in public activities or submissions.\n<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may deploy technology such as application programming interfaces (or “APIs”) for use by third party application developers and make information concerning your public activities on the Sites, such as your comments on community message boards, available to third party websites and applications.\nIf you use such third party websites and applications, they may also collect, process and share your information, including personal information.\nYou should review the privacy policies of any third party websites or applications before using them.&nbsp.\n<\/li>\n<li>We may share information about you in the event that the Sites are acquired by a third party or third parties, or as part of a sale, merger, bankruptcy or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events.&nbsp.\n<\/li>\n<li>We may share information about you for any other purposes disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or pursuant to your consent.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please note that the third parties may independently collect data about you, through cookies, clicks on links, or other means when you visit or view ads on the Sites.<\/p>\n<p>We work closely with our affiliated companies, such as our parent companies and their affiliated entities and subsidiaries under common ownership or control.\nWe share your information with our affiliates that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy.\nIn some cases, these affiliates may operate portions of the Sites or aspects of related services, or market or sell offerings to you.\nIn other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell digital content or other offering jointly with these affiliates.<\/p> 5.\nYour choices, cookies and other tracking technologies and “do not track” signals Deactivating your account <p>If the Sites functionality permits, you can deactivate your account at any time by visiting the

deactivate your account, your user profile will be disabled, but your public comments will remain on the Sites.\nWe have no responsibility, other than as may be required by applicable law, to take down, remove, or edit any of your public activities or any submissions that are a result of your public activities.\nFor more information, please review our Terms of Use.<\/p> Cookies and other tracking technologies <p>Some information that is collected about you is collected automatically through cookies and other tracking technologies.\nCookies are small amounts of information stored in files within your computer's browser.\nWe may use these technologies to collect information about your activity, browser and device, and to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our third party partners, such as advertising.\nMost web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but, if you prefer, you can usually remove or reject cookies through the settings on your browser or device.\nHowever, please note that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.\nPlease see our Cookie Policy for more information about how we use cookies and your choices.\n<\/p> “Do not track” signals <p>The “do not track” (or “DNT”) concept has been promoted by regulatory authorities for the internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.\nVarious web browsers offer a DNT option that sends a signal to websites visited by the user’s browser about the user's DNT preference.\nYou can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's “preferences” or similar settings.\nAs of the time of the posting of this Privacy Policy, there is no internet industry DNT technology standard.\nWe take privacy and security seriously.\nWith regard to DNT, the Sites do not currently respond to DNT signals in browsers because, as mentioned above, no DNT standard has been adopted.\nHowever, as explained above, you do have choices regarding how your browser handles cookies and other similar technologies.\n<\/p> Third Party Online Advertising <p>Some of the advertisements you see on the Sites are from third parties, such as advertising agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and audience segment providers.\nThese third parties may collect information about you and your online activities, either on the Sites or on other websites, through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to understand your interests and tailor certain advertisements to your interests.<\/p>\n<p>The Company does not have control over, or access to the information these non-affiliated third parties may collect.\nSuch third parties' information practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on the Sites, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about how we use cookies and your choices, please see our Cookie Policy.\n<\/p> 6.\nAccess <p>If you choose to share personal information with us, you may update or amend this information by contacting us at legal@mail.myanimelist.net.\nPlease include in your email

their personal information, as we describe further below.<\/p>\n<p>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights:<\/p>\n<p>As a California resident, you have the right to request that we

context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with

your minor child.\nYou may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.\nThe verifiable consumer request must (a) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and (b) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.\nMaking a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\nWe will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.<\/p>\n<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receipt, but if we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\nAny disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.\nIf we cannot comply with the request, our response will explain the reasons we cannot comply.\nFor data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to easily transfer the information from one entity to another entity.\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable

authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is 13 to 15 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.\nConsumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you can click on the “Do not sell my data” link available on our homepage and other pages of this website.\nYou will then have the option of clicking on a toggle button or checking a box and confirming your choice to opt-out.\nOnce you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.\nHowever, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by clicking on the “Do not sell my data” link again and unchecking the box or clicking on the toggle button again and confirming your choice to opt back in.<\/p> Non-Discrimination <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nUnless permitted by the CCPA, we will not do any of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or

CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.\nAny CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.\nParticipation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.<\/p> Other California Privacy Rights <p>If you are a California resident, under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) you may request further information about our practices related to disclosing your personal information to certain third parties and/or opt-out of our sharing of your personal information with unaffiliated third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.\nPlease send

release such information only to third parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality, security and integrity.\nWe retain children’s personal information only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and delete such information using reasonable measures to protect against its unauthorized access or use.<\/p>\n<p>In the event that we learn that we have

personal information can, at any time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review, correct, or delete the child’s personal information.\nand/or<\/li>\n<li>Revoke permission for us to further collect, use or share the

personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to easily transfer the information from one entity to another entity.\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable

authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is 13 to 15 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.\nConsumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you can click on the “Do not sell my data” link available on our homepage and other pages of this

data” link again and unchecking the box or clicking on the toggle button again and confirming your choice to opt back in.<\/p> Non-Discrimination <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nUnless permitted by the CCPA, we will not do any of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or

CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.\nAny CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.\nParticipation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.<\/p> Other California Privacy Rights <p>If you are a California resident, under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) you may request further information about our practices related to disclosing your

context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with

your minor child.\nYou may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.\nThe verifiable consumer request must (a) provide sufficient

that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make

personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to easily transfer the information from one entity to another entity.\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable

authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is 13 to 15 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.\nConsumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you can click on the “Do not sell my data” link available on our homepage and other pages of this

data” link again and unchecking the box or clicking on the toggle button again and confirming your choice to opt back in.<\/p> Non-Discrimination <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nUnless permitted by the CCPA, we will not do any of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or

terms that describe the program’s material aspects.\nParticipation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.<\/p> Other California Privacy Rights <p>If you are a California resident, under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) you may request further information about our practices related to disclosing your

you submit can be read, collected, or used by others.\nPlease exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in public activities or submissions.\n<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may deploy technology such as application programming interfaces (or “APIs”) for use by third party application developers and make information concerning your public activities on the Sites, such as your comments on community message boards, available to third party websites and applications.\nIf you use such third party websites and applications, they may also collect, process and share your information, including personal information.\nYou should review the privacy policies of any third party websites or applications before using them.&nbsp.\n<\/li>\n<li>We may share information about

tracking technologies <p>Some information that is collected about you is collected automatically through cookies and other tracking technologies.\nCookies are small amounts of information stored in files within your computer's browser.\nWe may use these technologies to collect information about your activity, browser and device, and to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our third party partners, such as advertising.\nMost web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but, if you prefer, you can usually remove or reject cookies through the settings on your browser or device.\nHowever, please note that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.\nPlease see our Cookie Policy for more information about how we use cookies and your choices.\n<\/p> “Do not track” signals <p>The “do not track” (or “DNT”) concept has been promoted by regulatory authorities for the internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.\nVarious web browsers offer a DNT option that sends a signal to websites visited by the user’s browser about the user's DNT preference.\nYou can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's “preferences” or similar settings.\nAs of the time of the posting of this Privacy Policy, there is no internet industry DNT technology standard.\nWe take privacy and security seriously.\nWith regard to DNT, the Sites do not currently respond to DNT signals in browsers because, as mentioned above, no DNT standard has been adopted.\nHowever, as explained above, you do have choices regarding how your browser handles cookies and other similar technologies.\n<\/p> Third Party Online Advertising <p>Some of the advertisements you see on the Sites are from third parties, such as advertising agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and audience segment providers.\nThese third parties may collect information about you and your online activities, either on the Sites or on other websites, through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to understand your interests and tailor certain advertisements to your interests.<\/p>\n<p>The Company does not have control over, or access to the information these non-affiliated third parties may collect.\nSuch third parties' information practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on the Sites, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about how we use cookies and your choices, please see our Cookie Policy.\n<\/p> 6.\nAccess <p>If you choose to share personal information with us, you may update or amend this information by contacting us at legal@mail.myanimelist.net.\nPlease include in your email

your minor child.\nYou may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.\nThe verifiable consumer request must (a) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and (b) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make

information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you can click on the “Do not sell my data” link available on our homepage and other pages of this

data” link again and unchecking the box or clicking on the toggle button again and confirming your choice to opt back in.<\/p> Non-Discrimination <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nUnless permitted by the CCPA, we will not do any of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or

terms that describe the program’s material aspects.\nParticipation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.<\/p> Other California Privacy Rights <p>If you are a California resident, under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) you may request further information about our practices related to disclosing your

context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with

with us.<\/li>\n<li>Comply with a legal obligation.<\/li>\n<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided

your minor child.\nYou may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.\nThe verifiable consumer request must (a) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and (b) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.\nMaking a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\nWe will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.<\/p>\n<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receipt, but if we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\nAny disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.\nIf we cannot comply with the request, our response will explain the reasons we cannot comply.\nFor data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to easily transfer the information from one entity to another entity.\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.<\/p>\n<p>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights:<\/p>\n<p>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your

authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is 13 to 15 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.\nConsumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you can click on the “Do not sell my data” link available on our homepage and other pages of this website.\nYou will then have the option of clicking on a toggle button or checking a box and confirming your choice to opt-out.\nOnce you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.\nHowever, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by clicking on the “Do not sell my data” link again and unchecking the box or clicking on the toggle button again and confirming your choice to opt back in.<\/p> Non-Discrimination <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nUnless permitted by the CCPA, we will not do any of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.<\/li>\n<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Suggest that you may

CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.\nAny CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.\nParticipation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.<\/p> Other California Privacy Rights <p>If you are a California resident, under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) you may request further information about our practices related to disclosing your
