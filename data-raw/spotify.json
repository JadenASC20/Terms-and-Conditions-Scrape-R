us<\/p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of

prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.\nYou may terminate the Agreements at any time.\nTo learn how to terminate your Spotify account, please contact us through the

its negligence, and, if required by applicable law, gross negligence.<\/p>\n<p>YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY MUST BE COMMENCED (BY FILING A DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION UNDER SECTION (24.2.1) OR

writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you

activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us

consent mechanism.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Third party applications and devices you connect to your Spotify Account<\/strong> If you connect your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as ‘Your Spotify Followers’.\nFor example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists.\nIf you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.\n<strong>Artists and record labels<\/strong>\nYou may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) with artists, record labels, or other partners who may want to directly send you news or promotional offers.\nYou will always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time.\n<p>Learn more about how to manage notifications, your publicly available information, and what you share with others in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or by sending you an email and/or a device notification.\nWe may notify you in advance.<\/p>\n<p>Please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully.<\/p>\n<p>If

collected or generated through your use of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Publicly available information<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will always be publicly available on the Spotify Service: your name and/or username, profile picture, who you follow and who follows you on the Spotify Service, your recently played artists, and your public playlists.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Personal data you may choose to share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will only be shared with the categories of recipients outlined in the table below if:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>you choose to make use of a specific Spotify Service feature where sharing of particular personal data is required for the proper use of the Spotify Service feature.\nor<\/li>\n<li>you grant us your permission to share the personal data, e.g.\nby selecting the appropriate setting in the Spotify Service or authorizing Spotify through a presented consent mechanism.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Third party applications and devices you connect to your Spotify Account<\/strong> If you connect your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as ‘Your Spotify Followers’.\nFor example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists.\nIf you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.\n<strong>Artists and record labels<\/strong>\nYou may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) with artists, record labels, or other partners who may want to directly send you news or promotional offers.\nYou will always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time.\n<p>Learn more about how to manage notifications, your publicly available information, and what you share with others in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or by sending you an email and/or a device notification.\nWe may notify you in advance.<\/p>\n<p>Please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to find out more about this Policy and how Spotify uses your personal data, please visit the Privacy Center on spotify.com to find out more.<\/p> 13.\nHow to contact us <p>Thank you for

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending

consent mechanism.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Third party applications and devices you connect to your Spotify Account<\/strong> If you connect your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as ‘Your Spotify Followers’.\nFor example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists.\nIf you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.\n<strong>Artists and record labels<\/strong>\nYou may choose to share personal data

<strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or by sending you an email and/or a device notification.\nWe may notify you in advance.<\/p>\n<p>Please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully.<\/p>\n<p>If

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service

thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p> 12 Brand Accounts <p>If you establish a Spotify account

Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the

or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.\nYou may terminate the Agreements at any time.\nTo learn how to terminate your Spotify account, please contact us through the Customer Service contact form which is available on our About Us page.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>Sections 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 herein, as well as any other

rights.\nFurthermore, the rights to terminate, rescind, or agree to any variation, waiver, or settlement of the Agreements are not subject to the consent of any other person.<\/p>\n<p>If you have downloaded the App from the Apple, Inc.\n(“Apple”) App Store or if you are using the App on an iOS device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the following notice regarding Apple.\nThis Agreement is between you and Spotify only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Service and the content thereof.\nApple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any

U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.<\/p> 20 Entire Agreement <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not

brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own

playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made

suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and

Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending

your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the

<strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User

activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third

covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial

example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou

playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the

individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made

suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and

oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending

your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as ‘Your Spotify Followers’.\nFor example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists.\nIf you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.\n<strong>Artists and record labels<\/strong>\nYou may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) with artists, record labels, or other partners who may want to directly send you news or promotional offers.\nYou will always have the option to change your mind and

Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice

collected or generated through your use of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Publicly available information<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will always be publicly available on the Spotify Service: your name and/or username, profile picture, who you follow and who follows you on the Spotify Service, your recently played artists, and your public playlists.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Personal data you may choose to share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will only be shared with the categories of recipients outlined in the table below if:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>you choose to make use of a specific Spotify Service feature where sharing of particular personal data is required for the proper use of the Spotify Service feature.\nor<\/li>\n<li>you grant us your permission to share the personal data, e.g.\nby selecting the appropriate setting in the Spotify Service or authorizing Spotify through a presented consent mechanism.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Third party applications and devices you connect to your Spotify Account<\/strong> If you connect your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as ‘Your Spotify Followers’.\nFor example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists.\nIf you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.\n<strong>Artists and record labels<\/strong>\nYou may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) with artists, record labels, or other partners who may want to directly send you news or promotional offers.\nYou will always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time.\n<p>Learn more about how to manage notifications, your publicly available information, and what you share with others in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or by sending you an email and/or a device notification.\nWe may notify you in advance.<\/p>\n<p>Please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to find out more about this Policy and how Spotify uses your personal data, please visit the Privacy Center on spotify.com to find out more.<\/p> 13.\nHow to contact us <p>Thank you for

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the

regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements,

us<\/p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

Spotify’s sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational.\nHowever, certain technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p> 12 Brand Accounts <p>If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand (a “Brand,” and such account a “Brand Account”), the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout the Agreements, apply to both you and the Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of

prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.\nYou may terminate the Agreements at any time.\nTo learn how to terminate your Spotify account, please contact us through the Customer Service contact form which is available on our About Us page.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>Sections 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 herein, as well as any other sections of the Agreements that, either explicitly or by their nature, must remain in effect even after termination of the Agreements, shall survive

Agreements create any third party beneficiary rights.\nFurthermore, the rights to terminate, rescind, or agree to any variation, waiver, or settlement of the Agreements are not subject to the consent of any other person.<\/p>\n<p>If you have downloaded the App from the Apple, Inc.\n(“Apple”) App Store or if you are using the App on an iOS device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and

country.\nand (2) you are not listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.<\/p> 20 Entire Agreement <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve

agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The

after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third

pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us

order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of

we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify

reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation

its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made

suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or

to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

forms provided by Spotify, that any Content infringes a copyright, Spotify may in its sole discretion remove such Content from the Service, or take other steps that Spotify deems appropriate, without

submit a counter-notification to Spotify with a request to restore the removed content, which Spotify may or may not honor, in Spotify’s sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational.\nHowever, certain technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content

or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify

regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service

temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance

thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p> 12 Brand Accounts <p>If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand (a “Brand,” and such account a “Brand Account”), the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout the Agreements, apply to both you and the Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the

software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under the Agreements to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.\nYou may terminate the Agreements at any time.\nTo learn how to terminate your Spotify account, please contact us through the Customer Service contact form which is available on our

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending

collected or generated through your use of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Publicly available information<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will always be publicly available on the Spotify Service: your name and/or username, profile picture, who you follow and who follows you on the Spotify Service, your recently played artists, and your public playlists.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Personal data you may choose to share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will only be shared with the categories of recipients outlined in the table below if:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>you choose to make use of a specific Spotify Service feature where sharing of particular personal data is required for the proper use of the Spotify Service feature.\nor<\/li>\n<li>you grant us your permission to share the personal data, e.g.\nby selecting the appropriate setting in the Spotify Service or authorizing Spotify through a presented consent mechanism.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Third party applications and devices you connect to your Spotify Account<\/strong> If you connect your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as ‘Your Spotify Followers’.\nFor example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists.\nIf you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.\n<strong>Artists and record labels<\/strong>\nYou may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) with artists, record labels, or other partners who may want to directly send you news or promotional offers.\nYou will always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time.\n<p>Learn more about how to manage notifications, your publicly available information, and what you share with others in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or by sending you an email and/or a device notification.\nWe may notify you in advance.<\/p>\n<p>Please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully.<\/p>\n<p>If

collected or generated through your use of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Publicly available information<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will always be publicly available on the Spotify Service: your name and/or username, profile picture, who you follow and who follows you on the Spotify Service, your recently played artists, and your public playlists.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Personal data you may choose to share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will only be shared with the categories of recipients outlined in the table below if:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>you choose to make use of a specific Spotify Service feature where sharing of particular personal data is required for the proper use of the Spotify Service feature.\nor<\/li>\n<li>you grant us your permission to share the personal data, e.g.\nby selecting the appropriate setting in the Spotify Service or authorizing Spotify through a presented consent mechanism.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Third party applications and devices you connect to your Spotify Account<\/strong> If you connect your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as ‘Your Spotify Followers’.\nFor example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists.\nIf you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.\n<strong>Artists and record labels<\/strong>\nYou may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) with artists, record labels, or other partners who may want to directly send you news or promotional offers.\nYou will always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time.\n<p>Learn more about how to manage notifications, your publicly available information, and what you share with others in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or by sending you an email and/or a device notification.\nWe may notify you in advance.<\/p>\n<p>Please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to find out more about this Policy and how Spotify uses your personal data, please visit the Privacy Center on spotify.com to find out more.<\/p> 13.\nHow to contact us <p>Thank you for

agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,

Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California

your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or

for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the

<strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the

activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third

covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice

you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not

brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter

Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and

U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.<\/p> 20 Entire Agreement <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the service or to receive further information regarding

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

property owners.\nIf you believe that any Content infringes your intellectual property rights or other rights, see Spotify’s copyright policy If Spotify is notified by a copyright holder, using the forms provided by Spotify, that any Content infringes a copyright, Spotify may in its sole discretion remove such Content from the Service, or take other steps that Spotify deems appropriate, without prior notification to the user or other party who supplied or posted that Content.\nIf such user or other party believes that the Content is not infringing, he or she may in certain circumstances submit a counter-notification to Spotify with a request to restore the removed content, which Spotify may or may not honor, in Spotify’s sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service

temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content

Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the

software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under the Agreements to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the

Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in

Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL

Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few

not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service

temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance

thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p> 12 Brand Accounts <p>If you establish a Spotify account

Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the Spotify Service.\nBy using the Spotify Support Community, you agree to the Community Terms.<\/p> 14 Customer support <p>For customer support with account-related and payment-related questions

applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) maintained by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) maintained by the Department of State.\nYou warrant that you are (1) not located in any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any economic sanctions.\nand (2) not a denied party as specified in any applicable export or re-export laws or

software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under the Agreements to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to

oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial

Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not

brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made

Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending

Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or

Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us

order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any

country.\nand (2) you are not listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.<\/p> 20 Entire Agreement <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter

Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few

Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable

users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the

Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced

that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by

with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in

individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

property owners.\nIf you believe that any Content infringes your intellectual property rights or other rights, see Spotify’s copyright policy If Spotify is notified by a copyright holder, using the forms provided by Spotify, that any Content infringes a copyright, Spotify may in its sole discretion remove such Content from the Service, or take other steps that Spotify deems appropriate, without

submit a counter-notification to Spotify with a request to restore the removed content, which Spotify may or may not honor, in Spotify’s sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational.\nHowever, certain technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p> 12 Brand Accounts <p>If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand (a “Brand,” and such account a “Brand Account”), the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout the Agreements, apply to both you and the Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the Spotify Service.\nBy using the Spotify Support Community, you agree to the Community Terms.<\/p> 14 Customer support <p>For customer support with account-related and payment-related questions (“Customer Support Queries”), please submit a ticket to our Customer Service department using the Customer Service contact form on the About Us section of our website.\nWe will use reasonable endeavors to respond to all Customer Support Queries within a reasonable time frame but we make no promises that any Customer Support Queries will be responded to within any particular time frame and/or that we will be able to answer any such queries.<\/p> 15 Export control <p>Spotify’s products may be subject to U.S.\nexport and re-export control laws and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) maintained by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) maintained by the Department of State.\nYou warrant that you are (1) not located in any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any economic sanctions.\nand (2) not a denied party as specified in any applicable export or re-export laws or regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control laws and regulations, including the EAR, trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC, and the ITAR.\nSpecifically, you agree that you shall not – directly or indirectly – sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under the Agreements to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to

oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the service or to receive further information regarding

you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile

brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou

Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or

Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements,

us<\/p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of

prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.\nYou may terminate the Agreements at any time.\nTo learn how to terminate your Spotify account, please contact us through the

its negligence, and, if required by applicable law, gross negligence.<\/p>\n<p>YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY MUST BE COMMENCED (BY FILING A DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION UNDER SECTION (24.2.1) OR

notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the App to you.\nand, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Service.\nApple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Service or your possession and/or use of the Service, including: (1) product

is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third party claim that the Service and/or your possession and use of the App infringe that third party’s intellectual

acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.\nYou hereby represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.\nGovernment embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.\nGovernment as a “terrorist supporting” country.\nand (2) you are not listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.<\/p> 20 Entire Agreement <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter

Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable

users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the

and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to

Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements

representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service

Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content

users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the service or to receive further information regarding

sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive,

terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party

the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User

Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few

or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to

defense, settlement and discharge of any third party claim that the Service and/or your possession and use of the App infringe that third party’s intellectual property rights.\nYou agree to comply with any applicable third party terms, when using the Service.\nApple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.\nYou hereby represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.\nGovernment embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.\nGovernment as a “terrorist supporting” country.\nand (2) you are not listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.<\/p> 20 Entire Agreement <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou

Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few

oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid

regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the service or to receive further information regarding

us<\/p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

and reporting User Content <p>Spotify respects the rights of intellectual property owners.\nIf you believe that any Content infringes your intellectual property rights or other rights, see Spotify’s copyright policy If Spotify is notified by a copyright holder, using the forms provided by Spotify, that any Content infringes a copyright, Spotify may in its sole discretion remove such Content from the Service, or take other steps that Spotify deems appropriate, without prior notification to the user or other party who supplied or posted that Content.\nIf such user or other party believes that the Content is not infringing, he or she may in certain circumstances submit a counter-notification to Spotify with a request to restore the removed content, which Spotify may or may not honor, in Spotify’s sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational.\nHowever, certain technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p> 12 Brand Accounts <p>If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand (a “Brand,” and such account a “Brand Account”), the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout the Agreements, apply to both you and the Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the Spotify Service.\nBy using the Spotify Support Community, you agree to the Community Terms.<\/p> 14 Customer support <p>For customer support with account-related and payment-related questions (“Customer Support Queries”), please submit a ticket to our Customer Service department using the Customer Service contact form on the About Us section of our website.\nWe will use reasonable endeavors to respond to all Customer Support Queries within a reasonable time frame but we make no promises that any Customer Support Queries will be responded to within any particular time frame and/or that we will be able to answer any such queries.<\/p> 15 Export control <p>Spotify’s products may be subject to U.S.\nexport and re-export control laws and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) maintained by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) maintained by the Department of State.\nYou warrant that you are (1) not located in any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any economic sanctions.\nand (2) not a denied party as specified in any applicable export or re-export laws or regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control laws and regulations, including the EAR, trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC, and the ITAR.\nSpecifically, you agree that you shall not – directly or indirectly – sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under the Agreements to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may

these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you

that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or

rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or

activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial

brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the

example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou

playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any

Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements,

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few

or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to

responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Service or your possession and/or use of the Service, including: (1) product liability claims.\n(2) any claim that the Service fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement.\nand (3) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.\nApple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third party claim that the Service and/or your possession and use of the App infringe that third party’s intellectual property rights.\nYou agree to comply with any applicable third party terms, when using the Service.\nApple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.\nYou hereby represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.\nGovernment embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.\nGovernment as a “terrorist supporting” country.\nand (2) you are not listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.<\/p> 20 Entire Agreement <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the service or to receive further information regarding

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not

brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own

Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few

users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the

oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements

representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

us<\/p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

and reporting User Content <p>Spotify respects the rights of intellectual property owners.\nIf you believe that any Content infringes your intellectual property rights or other rights, see Spotify’s copyright policy If Spotify is notified by a copyright holder, using the forms provided by Spotify, that any Content infringes a copyright, Spotify may in its sole discretion remove such Content from the Service, or take other steps that Spotify deems appropriate, without prior notification to the user or other party who supplied or posted that Content.\nIf such user or other party believes that the Content is not infringing, he or she may in certain circumstances submit a counter-notification to Spotify with a request to restore the removed content, which Spotify may or may not honor, in Spotify’s sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational.\nHowever, certain technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p> 12 Brand Accounts <p>If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand (a “Brand,” and such account a “Brand Account”), the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout the Agreements, apply to both you and the Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the Spotify Service.\nBy using the Spotify Support Community, you agree to the Community Terms.<\/p> 14 Customer support <p>For customer support with account-related and payment-related questions (“Customer Support Queries”), please submit a ticket to our Customer Service department using the Customer Service contact form on the About Us section of our website.\nWe will use reasonable endeavors to respond to all Customer Support Queries within a reasonable time frame but we make no promises that any Customer Support Queries will be responded to within any particular time frame and/or that we will be able to answer any such queries.<\/p> 15 Export control <p>Spotify’s products may be subject to U.S.\nexport and re-export control laws and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) maintained by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) maintained by the Department of State.\nYou warrant that you are (1) not located in any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any economic sanctions.\nand (2) not a denied party as specified in any applicable export or re-export laws or regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control laws and regulations, including the EAR, trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC, and the ITAR.\nSpecifically, you agree that you shall not – directly or indirectly – sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under the Agreements to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those

example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you

activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial

brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the

section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou

and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the

individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these

Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few

or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to

defense, settlement and discharge of any third party claim that the Service and/or your possession and use of the App infringe that third party’s intellectual property rights.\nYou agree to comply with any applicable third party terms, when using the Service.\nApple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.\nYou hereby represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.\nGovernment embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.\nGovernment as a “terrorist supporting” country.\nand (2) you are not listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.<\/p> 20 Entire Agreement <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the service or to receive further information regarding

us<\/p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

Spotify’s sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify

functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and

addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of

laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may

non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the

these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you

activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable

regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the service or to receive further information regarding

us<\/p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

and reporting User Content <p>Spotify respects the rights of intellectual property owners.\nIf you believe that any Content infringes your intellectual property rights or other rights, see Spotify’s copyright policy If Spotify is notified by a copyright holder, using the forms provided by Spotify, that any Content infringes a copyright, Spotify may in its sole discretion remove such Content from the Service, or take other steps that Spotify deems appropriate, without prior notification to the user or other party who supplied or posted that Content.\nIf such user or other party believes that the Content is not infringing, he or she may in certain circumstances submit a counter-notification to Spotify with a request to restore the removed content, which Spotify may or may not honor, in Spotify’s sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational.\nHowever, certain technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p> 12 Brand Accounts <p>If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand (a “Brand,” and such account a “Brand Account”), the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout the Agreements, apply to both you and the Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the Spotify Service.\nBy using the Spotify Support Community, you agree to the Community Terms.<\/p> 14 Customer support <p>For customer support with account-related and payment-related questions (“Customer Support Queries”), please submit a ticket to our Customer Service department using the Customer Service contact form on the About Us section of our website.\nWe will use reasonable endeavors to respond to all Customer Support Queries within a reasonable time frame but we make no promises that any Customer Support Queries will be responded to within any particular time frame and/or that we will be able to answer any such queries.<\/p> 15 Export control <p>Spotify’s products may be subject to U.S.\nexport and re-export control laws and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) maintained by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) maintained by the Department of State.\nYou warrant that you are (1) not located in any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any economic sanctions.\nand (2) not a denied party as specified in any applicable export or re-export laws or regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control laws and regulations, including the EAR, trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC, and the ITAR.\nSpecifically, you agree that you shall not – directly or indirectly – sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under the Agreements to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or

writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you

that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not

brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou

Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS

Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending

you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and

or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we

have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.\nYou hereby represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.\nGovernment embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.\nGovernment as a “terrorist supporting” country.\nand (2) you are not listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.<\/p> 20 Entire Agreement <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the service or to receive further information regarding

us<\/p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

you use the Spotify Service and what you share.\nThe Spotify Service includes social and interactive features, including the ability to post User Content, share content, and make certain information

Spotify’s sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational.\nHowever, certain technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates required to reflect changes in relevant laws and

functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and

or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of

laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the

Agreements create any third party beneficiary rights.\nFurthermore, the rights to terminate, rescind, or agree to any variation, waiver, or settlement of the Agreements are not subject to the consent

writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you

that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise

rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or

activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid

regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational.\nHowever, certain technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p> 12 Brand Accounts <p>If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand (a “Brand,” and such account a “Brand Account”), the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout the Agreements, apply to both you and the Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the Spotify Service.\nBy using the Spotify Support Community, you agree to the Community Terms.<\/p> 14 Customer support <p>For customer support with account-related and payment-related questions (“Customer Support Queries”), please submit a ticket to our Customer Service department using the Customer Service contact form on the About Us section of our website.\nWe will use reasonable endeavors to respond to all Customer Support Queries within a reasonable time frame but we make no promises that any Customer Support Queries will be responded to within any particular time frame and/or that we will be able to answer any such queries.<\/p> 15 Export control <p>Spotify’s products may be subject to U.S.\nexport and re-export control laws and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) maintained by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) maintained by the Department of State.\nYou warrant that you are (1) not located in any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any economic sanctions.\nand (2) not a denied party as specified in any applicable export or re-export laws or regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control laws and regulations, including the EAR, trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC, and the ITAR.\nSpecifically, you agree that you shall not – directly or indirectly – sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise dispose of any products, software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under the Agreements to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to

oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at

you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou

into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any

Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements,

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few

users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when

or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under

defense, settlement and discharge of any third party claim that the Service and/or your possession and use of the App infringe that third party’s intellectual property rights.\nYou agree to comply with any applicable third party terms, when using the Service.\nApple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.\nYou hereby represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.\nGovernment embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.\nGovernment as a “terrorist supporting” country.\nand (2) you are not listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.<\/p> 20 Entire Agreement <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of

laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual

these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you

activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve

music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE

current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you

MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

us<\/p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

Spotify’s sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational.\nHowever, certain technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p> 12 Brand Accounts <p>If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand (a “Brand,” and such account a “Brand Account”), the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout the Agreements, apply to both you and the Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of

our website.\nWe will use reasonable endeavors to respond to all Customer Support Queries within a reasonable time frame but we make no promises that any Customer Support Queries will be responded to within any particular time frame and/or that we will be able to answer any such queries.<\/p> 15 Export control <p>Spotify’s products may be subject to U.S.\nexport and re-export control laws and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) maintained by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce, trade and economic sanctions

EAR, trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC, and the ITAR.\nSpecifically, you agree that you shall not – directly or indirectly – sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, or otherwise

activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California

collected or generated through your use of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Publicly available information<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will always be publicly available on the Spotify Service: your name and/or username, profile picture, who you follow and who follows you on the Spotify Service, your recently played artists, and your public playlists.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Personal data you may choose to share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will only be shared with the categories of recipients outlined in the table below if:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>you choose to make use of a specific Spotify Service feature where sharing of particular personal data is required for the proper use of the Spotify Service feature.\nor<\/li>\n<li>you grant us your permission to share the personal data, e.g.\nby selecting the appropriate setting in the Spotify Service or authorizing Spotify through a presented consent mechanism.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Third party applications and devices you connect to your Spotify Account<\/strong> If you connect your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as ‘Your Spotify Followers’.\nFor example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists.\nIf you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.\n<strong>Artists and record labels<\/strong>\nYou may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) with artists, record labels, or other partners who may want to directly send you news or promotional offers.\nYou will always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time.\n<p>Learn more about how to manage notifications, your publicly available information, and what you share with others in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or by sending you an email and/or a device notification.\nWe may notify you in advance.<\/p>\n<p>Please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to find out more about this Policy and how Spotify uses your personal data, please visit the Privacy Center on spotify.com to find out more.<\/p> 13.\nHow to contact us <p>Thank you for

you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content,

Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements,

us<\/p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of

prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have

its negligence, and, if required by applicable law, gross negligence.<\/p>\n<p>YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY MUST BE COMMENCED (BY FILING A DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION UNDER SECTION (24.2.1) OR

of any other person.<\/p>\n<p>If you have downloaded the App from the Apple, Inc.\n(“Apple”) App Store or if you are using the App on an iOS device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and

writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its

activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California

collected or generated through your use of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Publicly available information<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will always be publicly available on the Spotify Service: your name and/or username, profile picture, who you follow and who follows you on the Spotify Service, your recently played artists, and your public playlists.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Personal data you may choose to share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following personal data will only be shared with the categories of recipients outlined in the table below if:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>you choose to make use of a specific Spotify Service feature where sharing of particular personal data is required for the proper use of the Spotify Service feature.\nor<\/li>\n<li>you grant us your permission to share the personal data, e.g.\nby selecting the appropriate setting in the Spotify Service or authorizing Spotify through a presented consent mechanism.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Third party applications and devices you connect to your Spotify Account<\/strong> If you connect your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as ‘Your Spotify Followers’.\nFor example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists.\nIf you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.\n<strong>Artists and record labels<\/strong>\nYou may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) with artists, record labels, or other partners who may want to directly send you news or promotional offers.\nYou will always have the option to change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time.\n<p>Learn more about how to manage notifications, your publicly available information, and what you share with others in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or by sending you an email and/or a device notification.\nWe may notify you in advance.<\/p>\n<p>Please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to find out more about this Policy and how Spotify uses your personal data, please visit the Privacy Center on spotify.com to find out more.<\/p> 13.\nHow to contact us <p>Thank you for

us<\/p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other

Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New

your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or

<strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User

activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the

activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third

covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice

your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or

<strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User

activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the

activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third

covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice

your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the

Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice

your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or

for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as ‘Your Spotify Followers’.\nFor example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists.\nIf you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.\n<strong>Artists and record labels<\/strong>\nYou may choose to share personal data (for example, your email address) with artists, record labels, or other partners who may want to directly send you news or promotional offers.\nYou will always have the option to change your mind and

Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

forms provided by Spotify, that any Content infringes a copyright, Spotify may in its sole discretion remove such Content from the Service, or take other steps that Spotify deems appropriate, without prior notification to the user or other party who supplied or posted that Content.\nIf such user or other party believes that the Content is not infringing, he or she may in certain circumstances submit a counter-notification to Spotify with a request to restore the removed content, which Spotify may or may not honor, in Spotify’s sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User guidelines, please fill out our notice form.<\/p> 11 Service limitations and modifications <p>Spotify will make reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service

temporary interruptions.\nSpotify reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Spotify Service, with advance notice where possible, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service or any function or feature thereof.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees to Spotify for Paid Subscriptions that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments and cancellations section), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation.\nYou understand, agree, and accept that Spotify will make reasonable efforts, although it has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service.\nSpotify and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p> 12 Brand Accounts <p>If you establish a Spotify account on behalf of a company, organization, entity, or brand (a “Brand,” and such account a “Brand Account”), the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout the Agreements, apply to both you and the Brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a Brand Account, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in the Agreements and to bind the Brand to the Agreements.<\/p>\n<p>A Brand may follow users and create and share playlists, provided that the Brand does not take any action that implies an endorsement or commercial relationship between the Brand and the followed user, artist, songwriter, or any other person, unless the Brand has independently obtained the rights to imply such an endorsement.\nIn addition, Brands must be transparent to our users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when engaging in the foregoing practices.<\/p> 13 Spotify Support Community <p>The Spotify Support Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the

software, or technology (including products derived from or based on such technology) received from Spotify under the Agreements to any destination, entity, or person prohibited by any applicable laws or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.\nYou may terminate the Agreements at any time.\nTo learn how to terminate your Spotify account, please contact us through the Customer Service contact form which is available on our About Us page.\nThis section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>Sections 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 herein, as well as any other sections of the Agreements that, either explicitly or by their nature, must remain in effect even after termination of the Agreements, shall survive termination.<\/p> 17 Warranty disclaimer <p>YOU

downloaded the App from the Apple, Inc.\n(“Apple”) App Store or if you are using the App on an iOS device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the following notice regarding Apple.\nThis Agreement is between you and Spotify only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Service and the content thereof.\nApple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any

Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights

which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn

great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial

Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not

brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou

Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made

suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending

your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or

<strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User

activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third

covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice

group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such

Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as

to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age

your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or

<strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User

activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the

activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third

covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice

consent mechanism.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Third party applications and devices you connect to your Spotify Account<\/strong> If you connect your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.\nWith respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.\n<strong>Support community<\/strong>\nWhen you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username.\nThis will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.\n<strong>Your Spotify followers<\/strong>\nThere may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the

Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information we may share<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p> Categories of Recipients\nReason for sharing <strong>Service providers<\/strong> We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us.\nThese companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.\n<strong>Payment processors<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.\n<strong>Advertising partners<\/strong>\nWe work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service.\nThese partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service.\nWe and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.\n<strong>Spotify partners<\/strong>\nDepending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g.\nthrough a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account.\nWe may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service.\nWe also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.\n<strong>Academic researchers<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.\n<strong>Other Spotify group companies<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.\n<strong>Law enforcement and data protection authorities<\/strong>\nWe share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.\n<strong>Purchasers of our business<\/strong>\nWe will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.\nIn this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n7.\nData retention and deletion <p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nWe keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service.\nFor example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.<\/p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;<\/li>\n<li>Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,<\/li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote> 8.\nTransfer to other countries <p>Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy.\nSpotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country.\nYour personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.<\/p>\n<p>Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland.\nIn such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.<\/p>\n<p>For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 ‘Keeping your personal data safe’ of this Policy.<\/p> 9.\nLinks <p>We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties’ privacy practices and content.\nIf you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.<\/p> 10.\nKeeping your personal data safe <p>We are committed to protecting our users’ personal data.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.<\/p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.<\/p> 11.\nChildren <p>With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years.\nThe Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.<\/p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the “Age Limit”).\nIf you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 ‘Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control’ of this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data.\nThis may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.<\/p> 12.\nChanges to this Policy <p>We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.<\/p>\n<p>When we make material changes to this Policy, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few

users about disclosing any endorsements or consideration provided to artists, songwriters, users, or any other party and must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice when

or regulations of the United States or any other jurisdiction without obtaining prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.<\/p> 16 Term and termination <p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.\nSpotify may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Spotify Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements, or if we withdraw Services and/or Content (in which case we shall provide you with reasonable notice in advance of doing so).\nIf you or Spotify terminate the Agreements, or if Spotify suspends your access to

Apple.\nThis Agreement is between you and Spotify only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Service and the content thereof.\nApple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any

U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.<\/p> 20 Entire Agreement <p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.<\/p>\n<p>Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements.\nThat could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services.\nWhen you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.\nSome of those additional terms are listed on Spotify’s website.\nTo the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.<\/p> 21 Severability, waiver and interpretation <p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.<\/p>\n<p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”<\/p> 22 Assignment <p>Spotify may assign the Agreements, and any of its rights under the Agreements, in whole or in part, and Spotify may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.\nYou may not assign the Agreements, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.<\/p> 23 Indemnification <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of the Agreements or any one of them.\n(2) any User Content you post or otherwise contribute.\n(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Spotify Service.\nand (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.<\/p> 24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue 24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA with your email address and a request for the Agreements.\nIn addition, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite S-202, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at 1-800-952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint regarding the service or to receive further information regarding

welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”).\nThe Terms you see below are important because they:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify<\/li>\n<li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully.\nWe hope you’re sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.\nHere we go…<\/p> 1 Introduction <p>Thanks for choosing Spotify (“Spotify,” “we,” “us,” “our”).\nSpotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time.\nBy signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the “Spotify Service” or “Service”), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”).\nThe Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.\nIf you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify’s website.\nYou acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them.\nIf you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.<\/p>\n<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States.\nYou also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.<\/p> 2 Changes to the Agreements <p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements.\nWhen we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email.\nIn some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us.\nIf you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.<\/p> 3 Enjoying Spotify <p>Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.<\/p> 3.1 Service Options <p>You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account.\nCertain options are provided to you free-of-charge.\nThe Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service.” Other options require payment before you can access them (the “Paid Subscriptions”).\nWe may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nWe reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.<\/p>\n<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users.\nWe will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services.\nIf you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service.\nNote that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.\nYou may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party.\nIn such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.<\/p> 3.2 Trials <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).\nSpotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.\nBy providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.<\/p> 4 Payments and Cancellations 4.1 Billing <p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.\nor (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period (“Pre-Paid Period”).<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.\nPrice changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.\nSubject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.<\/p> 4.2 Renewal.\nCancellation <p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.\nWe do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.<\/p>\n<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service.\nIf you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.<\/p> 5 Using our service <p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors.\nWe grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, “Access”).\nThis Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify.\nYou promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.<\/p>\n<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices (“Devices”).<\/p>\n<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand (“Spotify Brand Features”) are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors.\nThe Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.<\/p>\n<p>You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.\nExcept for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.<\/p>\n<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.<\/p> 6 Third Party Applications and Devices <p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you.\nThese Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies.\nYou understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.<\/p> 7 User-Generated Content <p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.<\/p>\n<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content.\nIn all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements.\nSpotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party.\nRemoval or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.\nSpotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.\nYOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.<\/p> 8 Rights you grant us <p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same.\nIn any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify’s agreements with third parties.\nSome Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g.\npodcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.\nThe Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you.\nFeedback is considered a type of User Content.<\/p>\n<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g.\nperform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content.\nWhere applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.<\/p> 9 User guidelines <p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.\nWe’ve established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone.\nYou must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The

Jurisdiction <p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.\nFurther, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.<\/p> 24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n<em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.<\/em>\n<\/p> 24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration <p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.\nYou and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.<\/p> 24.2.2 Exceptions <p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn’t stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).<\/p> 24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver <p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.<\/p> 24.2.4 Arbitration rules <p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nSpotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.<\/p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.\nSpotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<\/p> 24.2.5 Notice.\nProcess <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nSpotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify’s last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.<\/p> 24.2.6 Enforceability <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.<\/p> 25 Contact us <p>If you have any questions concerning the Spotify Service or the Agreements, please contact Spotify Customer Service by visiting the About Us section of our website.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have the Agreements mailed to you electronically by sending
