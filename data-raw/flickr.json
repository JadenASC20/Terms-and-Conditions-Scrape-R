Flickr Policy on Cookies <p>Date of Last Revision: August 19, 2018<\/p>\n<p>What are cookies?<\/p>\n<p>Cookies are small strings of characters that can be placed on your computer or mobile device via standard browser techniques that uniquely identifies your browser or device.\nWe may use technologies like cookies, pixels and local storage to deliver, secure, and understand products and services.<\/p>\n<p>What are cookies used for?<\/p>\n<p>Cookies and other technologies allow a site or service to know if your computer or device has visited it before.\nThese technologies can then be used to deliver products and services, help us understand how the site or service is being used, help you navigate between pages efficiently, help remember your preferences, and generally enable and improve your experience in using those services.\nCookies can also help ensure marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.<\/p>\n<p>How long will cookies stay on my device?<\/p>\n<p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a \"persistent\" or \"session\" cookie.\nSession cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing.\nPersistent cookies stay on your computer or mobile device until they expire or are deleted.<\/p>\n<p>First and third party cookies<\/p>\n<p>First-party cookies are cookies that belong to Flickr, third-party cookies are cookies that another party accesses or places on your device through our Service.\nThird-party cookies may be placed on your device by someone providing a service for Flickr, for example to help us understand how our service is being used.\nThird-party cookies may also be placed on your device by our business partners so that they can use them to advertise products and services to you elsewhere on the Internet.\nThese companies’ use of cookies and similar technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Flickr Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Why does Flickr use cookies and similar technologies?<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies, pixels, local storage, and similar technologies to show you relevant content, improve your experience, and help protect Flickr and our users.\nWe may use these technologies to deliver the service, provide you with a service that is easy to use, enable you to move around the Service and use its features, such as accessing secure areas, and storing information so that Flickr can respond faster.\nWe may use these technologies to collect information about how you use the Service, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get error messages from certain pages.\nWe may use these technologies to allow us to remember choices you make (such as your user name, the currency you wish to view purchases in or content you have provided access credentials to) and tailor the Service to provide enhanced features and content for you.\nFlickr or our advertising partners may use these technologies to deliver advertising that is relevant to your interests, for example if you are already a Flickr customer, they could be used to not show you advertisements to join Flickr.\nThese technologies can remember that your device has visited a site or service, and may also be able to track your device's browsing activity on other sites or services other than Flickr which also make use of the services of these third parties.\nThis information may be shared with organizations outside Flickr, such as advertisers and/or advertising networks to deliver the advertising, and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.\nWe may use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products and services.<\/p>\n<p>The cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Category of Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Why we use these cookies<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Technical/Required<\/p>\n<p>These cookies are essential for our services to function properly.\nLike the other cookies we use, technical cookies may be either first-party cookies or third-party cookies.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Preferences<\/p>\n<p>We use these cookies to remember your settings and preferences.\nFor example, we may use these cookies to remember your language preferences.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Performance<\/p>\n<p>We use these cookies to collect information about how you interact with our services and to help us improve them.\nFor example, we may use these cookies to determine if you have interacted with a certain page.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analytics<\/p>\n<p>We use these cookies to help us understand and improve our services.For example, we can use these cookies to learn more about which features are the most popular with our users and where we may need to make improvements.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Advertising<\/p>\n<p>We and our advertising partners use these cookies to deliver advertisements, to make them more relevant and meaningful to visitors to our website, and to track the efficiency of our advertising campaigns.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>How to control cookies or other collection mechanisms<\/p>\n<p>Follow the instructions provided by your browser or mobile device (usually located within the \"Help\", \"Tools\" or \"Edit\" facility) to modify your cookie settings.\nPlease be advised that if you set your browser to disable cookies or other technologies, you may not be able to access certain parts of our Service and other parts of our Service will not work properly.\nIn addition, you have other choices with respect to how cookies are used:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install Google’s opt-out browser add-on.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>For information on how our advertising partners allow you to opt out of receiving ads based on your web browsing history, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info.\nEuropean users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To opt out of ads on Facebook, Pinterest, or Google that are targeted to your interests, use your Facebook, Pinterest, or Google Ads settings.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Check your mobile device for settings that control ads based on your interactions with the applications on your device.\nFor example, on your iOS device, enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting, and on your Android device, enable the “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To delete or disable flash cookies please visit https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/security.html.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> ","created_at":"2020-06-19

and video that they themselves have created.<\/p>\n<p>These Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of Flickr.\nDon't forget that your use of Flickr is subject to these Community Guidelines and our Terms of Service.<\/p>\n<p>Things to do<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Play nice<\/p>\n<p>We're a global community of many types of people, who all have the right to feel comfortable and who may not think what you think, believe what you believe, or see what you see.\nSo, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other members.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Only upload content that you have created.<\/p>\n<p>Respect the copyright of others.\nThis means don't steal photos or videos that other people have shared and pass them off as your own.\n(That's what favorites and galleries are for.)<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Moderate your content.<\/p>\n<p>All content on Flickr, whether public or private, has to be appropriately moderated using our safety and content filters.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Link back to Flickr when you post your Flickr content elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr makes it possible to post content hosted on Flickr to other web sites.\nPages on other web sites that display content hosted on Flickr must provide a link from each photo or video back to its page on Flickr.\nThis provides a way to get more information about the content and the photographer.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Enjoy Flickr!<\/p>\n<p>This is your community.\nCelebrate your creativity, be social and share what's important to you.\nSee the world through others' eyes, participate, find your muse, and expand your horizons!<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Things not to do<\/p>\n<p>Here's the deal: We like to give second chances.\nHowever, when we discover you stepping across any of the lines listed below, we will take action, which may mean deleting your account with or without warning.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Don't upload collections of photos that aren’t yours.<\/p>\n<p>This includes other people's photos, video, and/or stuff you've copied or collected from around the Internet.\nAccounts that consist of such collections may be deleted at any time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't violate copyright laws<\/p>\n<p>If you see photos or videos that you've created in another member's photostream, don't panic.\nThis is probably just a misunderstanding and not malicious.\nA good first step is to contact them via FlickrMail and politely ask them to remove it.\nIf that doesn’t work, you can file a Notice with Flickr's Designated Copyright Agent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't forget to moderate your content<\/p>\n<p>Set the appropriate content filters for your images and videos.\nIn general, anything containing mature content (e.g.\nnudity, gore) needs to be moderated appropriately.\nThis includes your buddy icon and cover photo.\nAlso, sexually explicit videos (e.g.\npornography) are not permitted.\nVideos of artistic nature or educational purpose that contain nudity may be allowed under the moderate safety setting.\nFor additional details check here.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t forget to set the appropriate content type<\/p>\n<p>Set the appropriate content type for your images.\nIn general, anything that is not a photo or video should be classified as a Screenshot or Art/Illustration.\nFor additional details check here.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t harm children<\/p>\n<p>To say that Flickr has a zero tolerance policy towards harmful content involving minors would be an understatement.\nIn protecting children from criminal predators, particularly in crimes involving child sexual abuse, we will aggressively report and cooperate with law enforcement with the goal of prosecuting to the full extent of the law.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, images, video, comments, faves, and other communications.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't be creepy.<\/p>\n<p>You know the guy.\nDon't be that guy.\nIf you are that guy, your account will be deleted.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't upload content that is illegal or prohibited.<\/p>\n<p>This includes but is not limited to drug use, bestiality, and terrorism.\nIf we find you doing it, your account will be deleted and we'll take appropriate action, which may include reporting you to law enforcement.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t harass other users<\/p>\n<p>Flickr is not a venue for you to harass, abuse, spam, impersonate, or intimidate others.\nSo, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other users.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t violate users’ privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr has a zero tolerance policy towards distributing sexually graphic images of another person without that person’s consent (Non-Consensual Pornography).\nIf you’re a victim, please go here for 24-hour support, and here to meet the Badass Army.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t use hate speech.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr has a zero-tolerance policy towards attacking a person or group based on, but is not limited to, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, disease, age, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity.\nHere are some suggestions for confronting hate online.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t promote or encourage self-harm.<\/p>\n<p>We do not tolerate promotion of self-harm or the encouragement of others to do things that might cause them to get hurt.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't host web graphics<\/p>\n<p>Flickr is not a place to host generic graphic elements of web page designs, logos, banners, icons, and other non-photographic elements.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t spam<\/p>\n<p>We do not tolerate spam, period.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, excessive favoriting, excessive commenting, deceptive tagging, deceptive photo titles and descriptions, or resource abuse.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't use Flickr for commercial activity, unless you’re a Flickr Pro.<\/p>\n<p>Only Flickr Pro members are permitted to link directly to a shopping cart, checkout page, or pricing pages on other sites.\nFlickr Pros may also list prices for their products in their Flickr photo descriptions.\nFor more information about Flickr Pro accounts go here.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>If you don't feel that you can abide by our Community Guidelines as outlined above, maybe Flickr isn't for you.\nWe've crafted these guidelines to ensure that everyone within the Flickr community has a good time.<\/p>\n<p>You may also want to check out our Help Center and Privacy Policy.\nIf you ever have any questions or comments, we'd love to hear from you.\nPlease feel free to drop us a line via our webform.<\/p>\n<p>The Flickreenos, Dec 17, 2018<\/p>

was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Flickr collects, uses and discloses information from and about you when you use the Flickr services, including the Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications and Flickr website (collectively, the \"Services\").\nIt does not cover data relating to the SmugMug service.<\/p>\n<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, if the changes are significant, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\nWe encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.<\/p>\n<p>For information about how to change your privacy settings, please see:

us.\nFor example, we collect information when you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create an account and subscribe to our digital photography, media hosting or other services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Purchase photo prints or other products or services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact us for any reason, such as to request help with the

fax number, credit card information, bank transfer information, title, gender, and other information you choose to provide.<\/p>\n<p>You have the option of telling us how you wish to be identified in connection with your photos, comments and elsewhere using the Services.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your \"nickname\") that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services<\/p>\n<p>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about your use of the Services, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log Information: We log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, screen resolution, color and depth, device identifiers and mobile network information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Location Information: With your consent, we may collect information about the location of your device.\nFor example, we use your location information to provide you with the option to add POI data to your photo.\nFor more details, please see \"Your Choices\" below.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo Location Information: When you upload a photo with geographical data (i.e.\nfrom a mobile device) or manually geotag your photo, we collect the location of that photo.\nWith your consent, we collect information about your location if you take a photo within the Flickr mobile application to add to your photo’s metadata.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>EXIF Data: Exchangeable Image File Format (“EXIF”) data is a record of the settings and other relevant metadata inserted by a digital camera when you take a photo or video such as camera type, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and location (as described above), among other information.\nUnless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr, Flickr receives and stores EXIF data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Object and Scene Type Recognition Technology<\/p>\n<p>We use image recognition algorithms to find visually similar images as well as to help you organize your photos and make it easier to search images.\nThis technology might identify and tag scenes, actions, objects.<\/p>\n<p>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies<\/p>\n<p>We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons and similar technologies.\nCookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to provide and improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits, and for our advertising and analytics purposes.\nWe use cookies to keep you logged in to the Services, to count the number of unique computers using the Services and to record your user preferences.\nWe may also collect information using web beacons (also known as \"tracking pixels\").\nWeb beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.\nYou may be able to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent.\nSome browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage, and Flash storage can be managed here.\nFor more information and more detailed options, please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section below.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect From Other Sources<\/p>\n<p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.\nFor example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.\nWe may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with our billing for the Services.\nWhen somebody buys a gift for you on our service, we’ll receive your shipping information from the purchaser.\nUsers also can share another person’s email address with us through features that can invite the other person to view the user’s content.<\/p>\n<p>Use of Information<\/p>\n<p>Our use of the following information, which we call “Photographer Personal Data,” is limited by our agreements with our registered users: (i) images and videos that the user uploads to or creates in the Services, and (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services.<\/p>\n<p>We use other information for the following purposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze, personalize and improve our Services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To provide the products and Services you order;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To respond to questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To facilitate contests, sweepstakes and surveys;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To comply with law and legal process and protect rights, safety and property.\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>For other purposes requested or permitted by our users or other relevant individuals, such as website visitors.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We also may use personal information to create appropriately aggregated or anonymized data, which is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and which we may use or disclose for any purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing of Information<\/p>\n<p>We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Flickr or others;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In connection with, or in anticipation of, any merger, divestiture, consolidation, bankruptcy, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company, or other significant corporate event (in which case the acquiring entity may use the information pursuant to its own privacy policies and procedures, to the extent legally permissible).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.<\/p>\n<p>Our sharing of Photographer Personal Data is governed by our agreement with the user who posted it.\nIf you contact us regarding a request or complaint about Photographer Personal Data, we may forward your communication to the user who posted it.<\/p>\n<p>Social Sharing Features and Third-Party Integrations<\/p>\n<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, the public, and others, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature, and depending on that entity’s other sharing practices.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may give certain third-party apps different levels of permissions to interact with your account to take advantage of things like photo editing tools.\nIf you want to stop using one of these apps and revoke your permission, click the \"Remove Permission\" link under \"Sharing &amp.\nExtending\" on your account page and remove that permission.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others<\/p>\n<p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.\nThese entities may use cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.\nThis information may be used by Flickr and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nFor more information about interest-based-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices from each browser that you use to access our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google’s collection or use of your data for ad personalization purposes in any particular browser there or at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences.\nYou also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on in each browser.\nYour device should also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<\/p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customer service;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving business activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing risks and legal issues.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\nFor example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We process a user’s Photographer Personal Data as the user’s “processor” (under the GDPR and similar laws) or “service provider” (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<\/p>\n<p>Security<\/p>\n<p>Flickr takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nFlickr cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<\/p>\n<p>Data Retention<\/p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.<\/p>\n<p>Data Transfers<\/p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by Flickr or our service providers or affiliates in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient’s participation in the EU- U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nFlickr has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification (which is part of the certification of our parent company, SmugMug, Inc.), please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in this Privacy Policy, the JAMS mechanism is available only to individuals whose personal data we receive pursuant to Privacy Shield.<\/p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nFlickr, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not Flickr) are responsible for their transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Your Choices<\/p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users’ Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<\/p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos that a Flickr user uploaded to or created in the Services, or any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that the same user added to those images and videos in the Services (Photographer Personal Data), please contact that user directly.\nFlickr processes this data on behalf of the user, and the user has responsibility for handling these requests.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, Flickr is the user’s “processor” of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Flickr is the user’s “service provider” for this data.\n(Flickr still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported as described here.)<\/p>\n<p>Flickr users can follow the instructions below to handle privacy requests or to otherwise manage their Photographer Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>Deleting Photos<\/p>\n<p>You can delete individual photos that you have on Flickr by selecting the photos that you wish to delete, then clicking the delete button.\nOr you can delete groups of photos using batch operations.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Sharing Features<\/p>\n<p>In the \"Privacy &amp.\nPermissions\" section of your Account Settings, you can determine who can see, download, or interact with your content by default.\nYou can control at a more granular level who can see each individual image or video by editing that item’s viewing privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Account Information<\/p>\n<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your online account or contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nYou may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and Permissions Settings<\/p>\n<p>In your account “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab under “Settings”, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your “screen name”) that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>EXIF Information<\/p>\n<p>By default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &amp.\nmodel of the camera you used to take the shot.\nYou can elect to hide this link in “Settings” under the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo’s EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis setting can be changed through your account “Privacy and Permissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Location Information<\/p>\n<p>When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application’s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis default display setting can be changed in the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” Settings in your account.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Geofences<\/p>\n<p>A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings.\nThese are useful for locations such as “home” or “school” that you would like to make more private than your global default.\nClick here to create your geofences and manage your geo preferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default.\nFurther, you can change the geo preferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.<\/p>\n<p>Auto-Uploadr Feature<\/p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature on mobile, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to Flickr.\nThese photos and videos will be stored as private (non-public) on Flickr until you choose to share them.\nYou can turn off auto-upload at any time in your mobile app settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above for options for controlling cookies and similar technology.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional Communications<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Flickr by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.<\/p>\n<p>Email Notifications<\/p>\n<p>Visit the “Emails and Notifications” area in your account Settings to edit your Flickr email notification settings.<\/p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<\/p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<\/p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Every individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<\/p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: Flickr Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<\/p>\n<p>UK: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd., Attn: Flickr Inc., 16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2B 5AH, United Kingdom<br> www.dp-dock.com<br> flickr@gdpr-rep.com<\/p>\n<p>Additional Privacy Details for California Residents<\/p>\n<p>The sections below apply to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<\/p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<\/p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA “sale” of California personal information<\/p>\n<p>Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.\nIn the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.\nHowever, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.\nRegardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<\/p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete certain information we have about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.\nYou can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.\n(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nSimilar exceptions are common in other laws.)<\/p>\n<p>To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.\nAlternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.\nNo other requests are accepted at that number.<\/p>\n<p>Contact Us<\/p>\n<p>We welcome your feedback.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or would like to contact us for any reason,

other related merchandise, products and services (\"Products\") through Flickr’s approved third party vendors and retailers (\"Flickr Vendors\").<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\nis owned by SmugMug, Inc.\nIn these Terms of Use, the term “SmugMug” refers to Flickr, Inc., together with SmugMug, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries and their respective employees, agents, affiliates and contractors.\nHowever, these Terms of Use do not apply to SmugMug-branded services offered by the SmugMug family of companies.\nPlease see https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms for terms of use applicable to those services.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY.\nBY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR FLICKR PRO SERVICES, OR CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and SmugMug have against each other are resolved (see Section 15 — Dispute Resolution).\nThese provisions require you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court.\nIf you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your use of the Services (such as your purchase of Products) is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use.\nIf you do not consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use any Services.\nIf you access the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you warrant that you are an authorized representative of such company or

modify, revise or otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new

within thirty (30) days of the posting of the revisions on the Site unless you notify SmugMug within such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop using the Services.\nTherefore, you should review these Terms of Use whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area, the preceding sentence is not intended to constitute your “consent” to any processing of your own personal data for purposes of the GDPR or local ePrivacy legislation, and Flickr will seek such consent separately from these Terms of Use where applicable law requires Flickr to have your consent.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>GENERAL TERMS<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Additional

15, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES.<\/p>\n<p>You and SmugMug agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Use or relating to the Services, Site or Flickr

you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Trials<\/p>\n<p>When you

SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS TERMINATED AND/OR CANCELED BY YOU OR FLICKR PRIOR TO THE END OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your

cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO

request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from Flickr.\nIf you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective at the end of any previously paid Subscription Term.\nBy way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, if you request the termination of your Subscription and you have two months remaining in your Subscription Term, such termination is effective at the end of the two months remaining in your Subscription Term and you will have access to the Flickr Pro Services for the remaining two months of such Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr may terminate a Subscription, or any user’s access to and use of the Flickr Pro Services, at any time for any reason at its sole discretion, which such termination will

appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination, cancellation or discontinuation occurs prior to the expiration of the applicable Subscription Term.<\/p>\n<p>You may change your email, credit card information or other Payment Information for your

Processing <\/li>\n<li>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Flickr Policy on Cookies <p>Date of Last Revision: August 19, 2018<\/p>\n<p>What are cookies?<\/p>\n<p>Cookies are small strings of characters that can be placed on your computer or mobile device via standard browser techniques that uniquely identifies your browser or device.\nWe may use technologies like cookies, pixels and local storage to deliver, secure, and understand products and services.<\/p>\n<p>What are cookies used for?<\/p>\n<p>Cookies and other technologies allow a site or service to know if your computer or device has visited it before.\nThese technologies can then be used to deliver products and services, help us understand how the site or service is being used, help you navigate between pages efficiently, help remember your preferences, and generally enable and improve your experience in using those services.\nCookies can also help ensure marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.<\/p>\n<p>How long will cookies stay on my device?<\/p>\n<p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a \"persistent\" or \"session\" cookie.\nSession cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing.\nPersistent cookies stay on your computer or mobile device until they expire or are deleted.<\/p>\n<p>First and third party cookies<\/p>\n<p>First-party cookies are cookies that belong to Flickr, third-party cookies are cookies that another party accesses or places on your device through our Service.\nThird-party cookies may be placed on your device by someone providing a service for Flickr, for example to help us understand how our service is being used.\nThird-party cookies may also be placed on your device by our business partners so that they can use them to advertise products and services to you elsewhere on the Internet.\nThese companies’ use of cookies and similar technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Flickr Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Why does Flickr use cookies and similar technologies?<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies, pixels, local storage, and similar technologies to show you relevant content, improve your experience, and help protect Flickr and our users.\nWe may use these technologies to deliver the service, provide you with a service that is easy to use, enable you to move around the Service and use its features, such as accessing secure areas, and storing information so that Flickr can respond faster.\nWe may use these technologies to collect information about how you use the Service, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get error messages from certain pages.\nWe may use these technologies to allow us to remember choices you make (such as your user name, the currency you wish to view purchases in or content you have provided access credentials to) and tailor the Service to provide enhanced features and content for you.\nFlickr or our advertising partners may use these technologies to deliver advertising that is relevant to your interests, for example if you are already a Flickr customer, they could be used to not show you advertisements to join Flickr.\nThese technologies can remember that your device has visited a site or service, and may also be able to track your device's browsing activity on other sites or services other than Flickr which also make use of the services of these third parties.\nThis information may be shared with organizations outside Flickr, such as advertisers and/or advertising networks to deliver the advertising, and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.\nWe may use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products and services.<\/p>\n<p>The cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Category of Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Why we use these cookies<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Technical/Required<\/p>\n<p>These cookies are essential for our services to function properly.\nLike the other cookies we use, technical cookies may be either first-party cookies or third-party cookies.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Preferences<\/p>\n<p>We use these cookies to remember your settings and preferences.\nFor example, we may use these cookies to remember your language preferences.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Performance<\/p>\n<p>We use these cookies to collect information about how you interact with our services and to help us improve them.\nFor example, we may use these cookies to determine if you have interacted with a certain page.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analytics<\/p>\n<p>We use these cookies to help us understand and improve our services.For example, we can use these cookies to learn more about which features are the most popular with our users and where we may need to make improvements.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Advertising<\/p>\n<p>We and our advertising partners use these cookies to deliver advertisements, to make them more relevant and meaningful to visitors to our website, and to track the efficiency of our advertising campaigns.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>How to control cookies or other collection mechanisms<\/p>\n<p>Follow the instructions provided by your browser or mobile device (usually located within the \"Help\", \"Tools\" or \"Edit\" facility) to modify your cookie settings.\nPlease be advised that if you set your browser to disable cookies or other technologies, you may not be able to access certain parts of our Service and other parts of our Service will not work properly.\nIn addition, you have other choices with respect to how cookies are used:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install Google’s opt-out browser add-on.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>For information on how our advertising partners allow you to opt out of receiving ads based on your web browsing history, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info.\nEuropean users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To opt out of ads on Facebook, Pinterest, or Google that are targeted to your interests, use your Facebook, Pinterest, or Google Ads settings.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Check your mobile device for settings that control ads based on your interactions with the applications on your device.\nFor example, on your iOS device, enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting, and on your Android device, enable the “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To delete or disable flash cookies please visit

agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>As of May 29, 2018, Flickr is owned and operated by Flickr, Inc.\nThese Terms of Use apply to your access to and use of Flickr.com (the “Site”), the official Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications, and the related Flickr services, such as Flickr Pro Services (collectively with the Site and the rest of the foregoing, the “Services”).\nFor example, these Terms of Use apply to your use of the Services to purchase photographic prints, videos or other related merchandise, products and services (\"Products\") through Flickr’s approved third party vendors and retailers (\"Flickr Vendors\").<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\nis owned by SmugMug, Inc.\nIn these Terms of Use, the term “SmugMug” refers to Flickr, Inc., together with SmugMug, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries and their respective employees, agents, affiliates and contractors.\nHowever, these Terms of Use do not apply to SmugMug-branded services offered by the SmugMug family of companies.\nPlease see https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms for terms of use applicable to those services.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY.\nBY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR FLICKR PRO SERVICES, OR CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and SmugMug have against each other are resolved (see Section 15 — Dispute Resolution).\nThese provisions require you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court.\nIf you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your use of the Services (such as your purchase of Products) is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use.\nIf you do not consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use any Services.\nIf you access the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you warrant that you are an authorized representative of such company or entity with the right to bind such company or

of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new Services following the posting of the revised Terms of Use or other notice will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.\nOtherwise, any changes or modifications will be effective within thirty (30) days of the posting of the revisions on the Site unless you notify SmugMug within such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop using the Services.\nTherefore, you should review these Terms of Use whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area, the preceding sentence is not intended to constitute your “consent” to any processing of your own personal data for purposes of the GDPR or local ePrivacy legislation, and Flickr will seek such consent separately from these Terms of Use where applicable law requires Flickr to have your consent.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>GENERAL TERMS<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Additional Policies<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use and the following

you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Trials<\/p>\n<p>When you

SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS TERMINATED AND/OR CANCELED BY YOU OR FLICKR PRIOR TO THE END OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your

cancel the Flickr Pro Services or any portions thereof, including the Subscription Plans and any policies, features and terms applicable thereto.\nIf the Flickr Pro Services, or any part thereof, to which you subscribe are permanently discontinued or canceled by Flickr, your Subscription will terminate, and we will have no further liability to you.\nYou acknowledge that the Flickr Pro Services

cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO

Subscription section of your Account Settings, or by sending a message through https://help.flickr.com/contact providing clear written notice of such request.\nWhen Flickr receives your termination request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from Flickr.\nIf you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective at the end of any previously paid Subscription Term.\nBy way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, if you request the termination of your Subscription and you have two months remaining in your Subscription Term, such

passionately committed to the privacy of our customers.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to create consistent standards for all of our users.\nThis agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Flickr collects, uses and discloses information from and about you when you use the Flickr services, including the Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications and Flickr website (collectively, the \"Services\").\nIt does not cover data relating to the SmugMug service.<\/p>\n<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, if the changes are significant, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\nWe encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.<\/p>\n<p>For information about how to change your privacy settings, please see: https://help.flickr.com/en_us/change-your-privacy-settings-rygl6XoJm.<\/p>\n<p>Collection of Information<\/p>\n<p>Information You Provide to Us<\/p>\n<p>We collect information you provide directly to us.\nFor example, we collect information when you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create an account and

with the option to add POI data to your photo.\nFor more details, please see \"Your Choices\" below.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo Location Information: When you upload a photo with geographical data (i.e.\nfrom a mobile device) or manually geotag your photo, we collect the location of that photo.\nWith your consent, we collect information about your location if you take a photo within the Flickr mobile application to add to your photo’s metadata.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>EXIF Data: Exchangeable Image File Format (“EXIF”) data is a record of the settings and other relevant metadata inserted by a digital camera when you take a photo or video such as camera type, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and location (as described above), among other information.\nUnless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr, Flickr receives and stores EXIF data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Object and Scene Type Recognition Technology<\/p>\n<p>We use image recognition algorithms to find visually similar images as well as to help you organize your photos and make it easier to search images.\nThis technology might identify and tag scenes,

here.\nFor more information and more detailed options, please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section below.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect From Other Sources<\/p>\n<p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.\nFor example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.\nWe may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with our billing for the Services.\nWhen somebody buys a gift for you on our service, we’ll receive your shipping information from the purchaser.\nUsers also can share another person’s email address with us through features that can invite the other person to view the user’s content.<\/p>\n<p>Use of Information<\/p>\n<p>Our use of the following information, which we call “Photographer Personal Data,” is limited by our agreements with our registered users: (i) images and videos that the user uploads to or creates in the Services, and (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services.<\/p>\n<p>We use other information for the following purposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze, personalize and improve our

facilitate contests, sweepstakes and surveys;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To comply with law and legal process and protect rights, safety and property.\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>For other purposes requested or permitted by our users or other relevant individuals, such as website visitors.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We also may use personal information to create appropriately aggregated or anonymized data, which is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and which we may use or disclose for any purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing of Information<\/p>\n<p>We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Flickr or others;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In connection with, or in anticipation of, any merger, divestiture, consolidation, bankruptcy, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company, or other significant corporate event (in which case the acquiring entity may use the information pursuant to its own privacy policies and procedures, to the extent legally permissible).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.<\/p>\n<p>Our sharing of Photographer Personal Data is governed by our agreement with the user who posted it.\nIf you contact us regarding a request or complaint about Photographer Personal Data, we may forward your communication to the user who posted it.<\/p>\n<p>Social Sharing Features and Third-Party Integrations<\/p>\n<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, the public, and others, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature, and depending on that entity’s other sharing practices.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may give certain third-party apps different levels of permissions to interact with your account to take advantage of things like photo editing tools.\nIf you want to stop using one of these apps and revoke your permission, click the \"Remove Permission\" link under \"Sharing &amp.\nExtending\" on your account page and remove that permission.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others<\/p>\n<p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.\nThese entities may use cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.\nThis information

advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices from each browser that you use to access our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google’s collection or use of your data for ad personalization purposes in any particular browser there or at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences.\nYou also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on in each browser.\nYour device should also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<\/p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customer service;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving business activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing risks and legal issues.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\nFor example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We process a user’s Photographer Personal Data as the user’s “processor” (under the GDPR and similar laws) or “service provider” (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<\/p>\n<p>Security<\/p>\n<p>Flickr takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nFlickr cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<\/p>\n<p>Data Retention<\/p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.<\/p>\n<p>Data Transfers<\/p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by Flickr or our service providers or affiliates in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient’s participation in the EU- U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nFlickr has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification (which is part of the certification of our parent company, SmugMug, Inc.), please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in this Privacy Policy, the JAMS mechanism is available only to individuals whose personal data we receive pursuant to Privacy Shield.<\/p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nFlickr, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not Flickr) are responsible for their transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Your Choices<\/p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users’ Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<\/p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos that a Flickr user uploaded to or created in the Services, or any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that the same user added to those images and videos in the Services (Photographer Personal Data), please contact that user directly.\nFlickr processes this data on behalf of the user, and the user has responsibility for handling these requests.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, Flickr is the user’s “processor” of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Flickr is the user’s “service provider” for this data.\n(Flickr still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported as described here.)<\/p>\n<p>Flickr users can follow the instructions below to handle privacy requests or to otherwise manage their Photographer Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>Deleting Photos<\/p>\n<p>You can delete individual photos that you have on Flickr by selecting the photos that you wish to delete, then clicking the delete button.\nOr you can delete groups of photos using batch operations.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Sharing Features<\/p>\n<p>In the \"Privacy &amp.\nPermissions\" section of your Account Settings, you can determine who can see, download, or interact with your content by default.\nYou can control at a more granular level who can see each individual image or video by editing that item’s viewing privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Account Information<\/p>\n<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your online account or contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nYou may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and Permissions Settings<\/p>\n<p>In your account “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab under “Settings”, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your “screen name”) that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>EXIF Information<\/p>\n<p>By default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &amp.\nmodel of the camera you used to take the shot.\nYou can elect to hide this link in “Settings” under the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo’s EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis setting can be changed through your account “Privacy and Permissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Location Information<\/p>\n<p>When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application’s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis default display setting can be changed in the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” Settings in your account.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Geofences<\/p>\n<p>A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings.\nThese are useful for locations such as “home” or “school” that you would like to make more private than your global default.\nClick here to create your geofences and manage your geo preferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default.\nFurther, you can change the geo preferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.<\/p>\n<p>Auto-Uploadr Feature<\/p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature on mobile, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to Flickr.\nThese photos and videos will be stored as private (non-public) on Flickr until you choose to share them.\nYou can turn off auto-upload at any time in your mobile app settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above for options for controlling cookies and similar technology.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional Communications<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Flickr by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.<\/p>\n<p>Email Notifications<\/p>\n<p>Visit the “Emails and Notifications” area in your account Settings to edit your Flickr email notification settings.<\/p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<\/p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<\/p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Every individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<\/p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: Flickr Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<\/p>\n<p>UK: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd., Attn: Flickr Inc., 16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2B 5AH, United Kingdom<br> www.dp-dock.com<br> flickr@gdpr-rep.com<\/p>\n<p>Additional Privacy Details for California Residents<\/p>\n<p>The sections below apply to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<\/p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<\/p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA “sale” of California personal information<\/p>\n<p>Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.\nIn the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.\nHowever, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.\nRegardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<\/p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete certain information we have about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.\nYou can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.\n(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nSimilar exceptions are common in other laws.)<\/p>\n<p>To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.\nAlternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.\nNo other requests are accepted at that number.<\/p>\n<p>Contact Us<\/p>\n<p>We welcome your feedback.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or would like to contact us for any reason, you may reach us via email at help@flickr.com or write to:<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Attention: Privacy Manager<\/p>\n<p>67 E Evelyn Ave, Ste 200<\/p>\n<p>Mountain View, CA 94041,

agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>As of May 29, 2018, Flickr is owned and operated by Flickr, Inc.\nThese Terms of Use apply to your access to and use of Flickr.com (the “Site”), the official Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications, and the related Flickr services, such as Flickr Pro Services (collectively with the Site and the rest of the foregoing, the “Services”).\nFor example, these Terms of Use apply to your use of the Services to purchase photographic prints, videos or other related merchandise, products and services (\"Products\") through Flickr’s approved third party vendors and retailers (\"Flickr Vendors\").<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\nis owned by SmugMug, Inc.\nIn these Terms of Use, the term “SmugMug” refers to Flickr, Inc., together with SmugMug, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries and their respective employees, agents, affiliates and contractors.\nHowever, these Terms of Use do not apply to SmugMug-branded services offered by the SmugMug family of companies.\nPlease see https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms for terms of use applicable to those services.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY.\nBY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR FLICKR PRO SERVICES, OR CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and SmugMug have against each other are resolved (see Section 15 — Dispute Resolution).\nThese provisions require you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court.\nIf you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your use of the Services (such as your purchase of Products) is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use.\nIf you do not consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use any Services.\nIf you access the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you warrant that you are an authorized representative of such company or entity with the right to bind such company or entity to these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>The Services are not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 16.\nIf you are between the ages of 16 and 18, you may use the Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p> SmugMug reserves the right to change, modify, revise or otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new Services following the posting of the revised Terms of Use or other notice will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.\nOtherwise, any changes or modifications will be effective within thirty (30) days of the posting of the revisions on the Site unless you notify SmugMug within such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop using the Services.\nTherefore, you should review these Terms of Use whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area, the preceding sentence is not intended to constitute your “consent” to any processing of your own personal data for purposes of the GDPR or local ePrivacy legislation, and Flickr will seek such consent separately from these Terms of Use where applicable law requires Flickr to have your consent.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>GENERAL TERMS<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Additional Policies<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use and the following additional Flickr terms and policies (as applicable) together constitute a binding agreement between you and SmugMug.\nAll such additional policies are incorporated into these Terms of Use as

stores and other platforms (e.g., the Apple App Store).\nIf you access and use the Services via the Flickr mobile application, or on a mobile phone, tablet or similar mobile device, you are bound by these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Data Processing Addendum<\/p>\n<p>The Flickr Data Processing Addendum supplements these Terms of Use and applies with respect to (i) the photos and videos you upload, and (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that you add to those photos and videos.\nTo the extent of any conflict between these Terms of Use and the Data Processing Addendum, the Data Processing Addendum will govern.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>License<\/p>\n<p>The Services and all images, software, platforms, tools, graphics, data, text, code, the Marks (as defined below) and other content and materials available on the Services (excluding User Content) and the selection and arrangement thereof (collectively, the “Flickr Materials”)

non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the Flickr Materials solely in accordance with these Terms of Use.\nExcept for the limited licenses granted hereunder, SmugMug reserves all rights not expressly granted and no such additional rights may be implied.\nYou acknowledge that (i) all right, title and interest in and to the Flickr Materials, including all patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other proprietary rights embodied therein or associated therewith, are and will remain with SmugMug or its third party licensors.\n(ii) no right or interest in the Flickr Materials is conveyed other than the limited licenses granted herein.\n(iii) the Flickr Materials are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.\nand (iv) SmugMug asserts that the Flickr Materials embody valuable confidential and secret information of SmugMug or its licensors, the development of which required the expenditure of considerable time and money.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Marks<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that “SMUGMUG”, the SmugMug logo, “FLICKR”, the Flickr logo, the look and feel of the Services, and any other Product or Service names,

permission of SmugMug.\nAll other trademarks, registered trademarks, product names and company names or logos mentioned in the Services are the property of their respective owners.<\/p>\n<p>SmugMug may provide users with tools to download the Marks via the Services.\nIf you download or otherwise obtain the Marks using such tools, SmugMug grants you a limited right to (i) use the Marks for the sole purpose of referencing the Services and (ii) to use only those Marks that are made available to you by SmugMug through such tools.\nYour use of any Marks must be consistent with the size, dimensions, color and other characteristics of the Marks and consistent with any other policies concerning the Marks that we may post on the Site or otherwise make available through the Services from

such user (the “Subscription Plan”).\nIf you wish to purchase a Subscription, we will ask you to provide certain information in order to facilitate such purchase, including your credit card number,

you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Trials<\/p>\n<p>When you

permitted under the user’s applicable Subscription Plan.\nFlickr, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit, suspend or terminate your use of the Flickr Pro Services if Flickr determines that you have violated these Flickr Pro Services Terms or the Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>Each Subscription is personal to the individual Flickr user.\nYou may not transfer or assign your Subscription to another individual, entity or Flickr user unless such transfer or assignment is expressly permitted by the terms of your Subscription Plan.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, Flickr may provide certain users with complimentary Subscriptions.\nAny user accessing the Services by using a free Subscription is bound by the Terms of Use and any applicable terms and conditions of these Flickr Pro Services Terms (including Flickr’s right to terminate or cancel such Subscriptions).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Term and Automatic Renewal<\/p>\n<p>Your Subscription is valid commencing on the date in which Flickr provides you with access to the Services pursuant to its receipt of your valid Payment Information (the “Commencement Date”) and will last for the duration of the Subscription term that you select at the time of your registration for the Flickr Pro Services (the “Subscription Term”).<\/p>\n<p>YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION TERM FOR SUCCESSIVE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS TERMINATED AND/OR CANCELED BY YOU OR FLICKR PRIOR TO THE END OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge at the time of Subscription renewal may differ from the Subscription Fees you originally paid for the Flickr Pro Services if: (i) the Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan changes during your applicable Subscription Term, or (ii) if you change your Subscription Plan or Subscription Term during the previous Subscription Term.\nFlickr will notify you of any changes to the Subscription Fee prior to the date on which your Subscription Term will renew.\nYou hereby agree to any such revised Subscription Fees

Services.\nChanges to Flickr Pro Services and Terms of Use<\/p>\n<p>Flickr reserves the right at any time, at its sole discretion and without notice, to suspend, modify, discontinue or permanently cancel the Flickr Pro Services or any portions thereof, including the Subscription Plans and any policies, features and terms applicable thereto.\nIf the Flickr Pro Services, or any part thereof, to which you subscribe are permanently discontinued or canceled by Flickr, your Subscription will terminate, and we will have no further liability to you.\nYou acknowledge that the Flickr Pro Services may be interrupted from time to time, with or without notice, for maintenance, upgrades, system updates or in the event of equipment failure or for any other foreseeable or non-foreseeable cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO

Subscription section of your Account Settings, or by sending a message through https://help.flickr.com/contact providing clear written notice of such request.\nWhen Flickr receives your termination request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from Flickr.\nIf you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective at the end of any previously paid Subscription Term.\nBy way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, if you request the termination of your Subscription and you have two months remaining in your Subscription Term, such termination is effective at the end of the two months remaining in your Subscription Term and you will have access to the Flickr Pro Services for the remaining two months of such Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr may terminate a Subscription, or any user’s access to and use of the Flickr Pro Services, at any time for any reason at its sole discretion, which such termination will be effective immediately.\nIf you violate the Terms of Use, Flickr at its sole discretion may (i) require you to remedy any violation thereof and/or (ii) take any other actions that Flickr deems appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination, cancellation or discontinuation occurs prior to the expiration of the applicable Subscription Term.<\/p>\n<p>You may change your email, credit card information or other Payment Information for your account by using the Account Settings available in your user profile.\nIt is solely your responsibility to keep your account information and Payment Information accurate and up-to-date.\nIf the Payment Information for your account is invalid and cannot be billed for the renewal Subscription Fee at the time such Subscription Fee is payable and due, then Flickr may terminate your Flickr Pro

Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of Flickr.\nDon't forget that your use of Flickr is subject to these Community Guidelines and our Terms of Service.<\/p>\n<p>Things to do<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Play nice<\/p>\n<p>We're a global community of many types of people, who all have the right to feel comfortable and who may not think what you think, believe what you believe, or see what you see.\nSo, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other members.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Only upload content that you have created.<\/p>\n<p>Respect the copyright of others.\nThis means don't steal photos or videos that other people have shared and pass them off as your own.\n(That's what favorites and galleries are for.)<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Moderate your content.<\/p>\n<p>All content on Flickr, whether public or private, has to be appropriately moderated using our safety and content filters.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Link back to Flickr when you post your Flickr content elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr makes it possible to post content hosted on Flickr to other web sites.\nPages on other web sites that display content hosted on Flickr must provide a link from each photo or video back to its page on Flickr.\nThis provides a way to get more information about the content and the photographer.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Enjoy Flickr!<\/p>\n<p>This is your community.\nCelebrate your creativity, be social and share what's important to you.\nSee the world through others' eyes, participate, find your muse, and expand your horizons!<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Things not to do<\/p>\n<p>Here's the deal: We like to give second chances.\nHowever, when we discover you stepping across any of the lines listed below, we will take action, which may mean deleting your account with or without warning.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Don't upload collections of photos that aren’t yours.<\/p>\n<p>This includes other people's photos, video, and/or stuff you've copied or collected from around the Internet.\nAccounts that consist of such collections may be deleted at any time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't violate copyright laws<\/p>\n<p>If you see photos or videos that you've created in another member's photostream, don't panic.\nThis is probably just a misunderstanding and not malicious.\nA good first step is to contact them via FlickrMail and politely ask them to remove it.\nIf that doesn’t work, you can file a Notice with Flickr's Designated Copyright Agent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't forget to moderate your content<\/p>\n<p>Set the appropriate content filters for your images and videos.\nIn general, anything containing mature content (e.g.\nnudity, gore) needs to be moderated appropriately.\nThis includes your buddy icon and cover photo.\nAlso, sexually explicit videos (e.g.\npornography) are not permitted.\nVideos of artistic nature or educational purpose that contain nudity may be allowed under the moderate safety setting.\nFor additional details check here.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t forget to set the appropriate content type<\/p>\n<p>Set the appropriate content type for your images.\nIn general, anything that is not a photo or video should be classified as a Screenshot or Art/Illustration.\nFor additional details check here.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t harm children<\/p>\n<p>To say that Flickr has a zero tolerance policy towards harmful content involving minors would be an understatement.\nIn protecting children from criminal predators, particularly in crimes involving child sexual abuse, we will aggressively report and cooperate with law enforcement with the goal of prosecuting to the full extent of the law.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, images, video, comments, faves, and other communications.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't be creepy.<\/p>\n<p>You know the guy.\nDon't be that guy.\nIf you are that guy, your account will be deleted.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't upload content that is illegal or prohibited.<\/p>\n<p>This includes but is not limited to drug use, bestiality, and terrorism.\nIf we find you doing it, your account will be deleted and we'll take appropriate action, which may include reporting you to law enforcement.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t harass other users<\/p>\n<p>Flickr is not a venue for you to harass, abuse, spam, impersonate, or intimidate others.\nSo, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other users.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t violate users’ privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr has a zero tolerance policy towards distributing sexually graphic images of another person without that person’s consent (Non-Consensual Pornography).\nIf you’re a victim, please go here for 24-hour support, and here to meet the Badass Army.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t use hate speech.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr has a zero-tolerance policy towards attacking a person or group based on, but is not limited to, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, disease, age, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity.\nHere are some suggestions for confronting hate online.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t promote or encourage self-harm.<\/p>\n<p>We do not tolerate promotion of self-harm or the encouragement of others to do things that might cause them to get hurt.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't host web graphics<\/p>\n<p>Flickr is not a place to host generic graphic elements of web page designs, logos, banners, icons, and other non-photographic elements.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t spam<\/p>\n<p>We do not tolerate spam, period.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, excessive favoriting, excessive commenting, deceptive tagging, deceptive photo titles and descriptions, or resource abuse.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't use Flickr for commercial activity, unless you’re a Flickr Pro.<\/p>\n<p>Only Flickr Pro members are permitted to link directly to a shopping cart, checkout page, or pricing pages on other sites.\nFlickr Pros may also list prices for their products in their Flickr photo descriptions.\nFor more information about Flickr Pro accounts go here.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In Conclusion<\/p>\n<p>If you don't feel that you can abide by our Community Guidelines as outlined above, maybe Flickr isn't for you.\nWe've crafted these guidelines to ensure that everyone within the Flickr community has a good time.<\/p>\n<p>You may also want to check out our Help Center and Privacy Policy.\nIf you ever have any questions or comments, we'd love to hear from you.\nPlease feel free to drop us a line via our webform.<\/p>\n<p>The Flickreenos, Dec 17,

for anyone to access, you can restrict access to a limited number of other Flickr users, or you can keep those photos private so only you can access them.\nIf you do not change your settings, your photos will be public by default, unless uploaded using mobile or desktop Auto-Uploadr features.\nOn each photo page, you will also find more granular controls to change each photo setting.\nWe may use the information we collect from public photos to match and serve targeted advertising (across devices and both on and off of our services) and provide relevant advertising based on your activity, inferred interests and location data information.\nAdvertisements shown to you may also be related to our analysis of your photos and textual information, such as metadata, including notes, associated with the photo you are seeing, or the search term you entered.<\/li>\n<li>We use information collected from all photos on Flickr for the following general purposes: <ul>\n<li>Provide, maintain, and

all photos or videos.\nBy default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo or video pages, and displays the make and

November 23, 2020<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\n(\"Flickr\") is passionately committed to the privacy of our customers.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to create consistent standards for all of our users.\nThis agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Flickr collects, uses and discloses information from and about you when you use the Flickr services, including the Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications and Flickr website (collectively, the \"Services\").\nIt does not cover data relating to the SmugMug service.<\/p>\n<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, if the changes are significant, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\nWe encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.<\/p>\n<p>For information about how to change your privacy settings, please see:

us.\nFor example, we collect information when you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create an account and subscribe to our digital photography, media hosting or other services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Purchase photo prints or other products or services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact us for any reason, such as to request help with the Services or to provide us with your comments/feedback.\nor<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Post information in connection with your photos (e.g., in a photo caption) or in other forums or interactive areas of the Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Otherwise communicate with Flickr.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, fax number, credit card information, bank transfer information, title, gender, and other information you choose to provide.<\/p>\n<p>You have the option of telling us how you wish to be identified in connection with your photos, comments and elsewhere using the Services.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your \"nickname\") that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services<\/p>\n<p>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about your use of the Services, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log Information: We log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, screen resolution, color and depth, device identifiers and mobile network information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Location Information: With your consent, we may collect information about the location of your device.\nFor example, we use your location information to provide you with the option to add POI data to your photo.\nFor more details, please see \"Your Choices\" below.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo Location Information: When you upload a photo with geographical data (i.e.\nfrom a mobile device) or manually geotag your photo, we collect the location of that photo.\nWith your consent, we collect information about your location if you take a photo within the Flickr mobile application to add to your photo’s metadata.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>EXIF Data: Exchangeable Image File Format (“EXIF”) data is a record of the settings and other relevant metadata inserted by a digital camera when you take a photo or video such as camera type, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and location (as described above), among other information.\nUnless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr, Flickr receives and stores EXIF data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Object and Scene Type Recognition Technology<\/p>\n<p>We use image recognition algorithms to find visually similar images as well as to help you organize your photos and make it easier to search images.\nThis technology might identify and tag scenes, actions, objects.<\/p>\n<p>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies<\/p>\n<p>We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons and similar technologies.\nCookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to provide and improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits, and for our advertising and analytics purposes.\nWe use cookies to keep you logged in to the Services, to count the number of unique computers using the Services and to record your user preferences.\nWe may also collect information using web beacons (also known as \"tracking pixels\").\nWeb beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.\nYou may be able to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent.\nSome browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage, and Flash storage can be managed here.\nFor more information and more detailed options, please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section below.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect From Other Sources<\/p>\n<p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.\nFor example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.\nWe may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with our billing for the Services.\nWhen somebody buys a gift for you on our service, we’ll receive your shipping information from the purchaser.\nUsers also can share another person’s email address with us through features that can invite the other person to view the user’s content.<\/p>\n<p>Use of Information<\/p>\n<p>Our use of the following information, which we call “Photographer Personal Data,” is limited by our agreements with our registered users: (i) images and videos that the user uploads to or creates in the Services, and (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services.<\/p>\n<p>We use other information for the following purposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze, personalize and improve our Services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To provide the products and Services you order;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To respond to questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To facilitate contests, sweepstakes and surveys;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To comply with law and legal process and protect rights, safety and property.\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>For other purposes requested or permitted by our users or other relevant individuals, such as website visitors.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We also may use personal information to create appropriately aggregated or anonymized data, which is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and which we may use or disclose for any purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing of Information<\/p>\n<p>We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Flickr or others;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In connection with, or in anticipation of, any merger, divestiture, consolidation, bankruptcy, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company, or other significant corporate event (in which case the acquiring entity may use the information pursuant to its own privacy policies and procedures, to the extent legally permissible).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.<\/p>\n<p>Our sharing of Photographer Personal Data is governed by our agreement with the user who posted it.\nIf you contact us regarding a request or complaint about Photographer Personal Data, we may forward your communication to the user who posted it.<\/p>\n<p>Social Sharing Features and Third-Party Integrations<\/p>\n<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, the public, and others, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature, and depending on that entity’s other sharing practices.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may give certain third-party apps different levels of permissions to interact with your account to take advantage of things like photo editing tools.\nIf you want to stop using one of these apps and revoke your permission, click the \"Remove Permission\" link under \"Sharing &amp.\nExtending\" on your account page and remove that permission.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others<\/p>\n<p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.\nThese entities may use cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.\nThis information may be used by Flickr and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nFor more information about interest-based-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices from each browser that you use to access our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google’s collection or use of your data for ad personalization purposes in any particular browser there or at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences.\nYou also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on in each browser.\nYour device should also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<\/p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customer service;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving business activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing risks and legal issues.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\nFor example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We process a user’s Photographer Personal Data as the user’s “processor” (under the GDPR and similar laws) or “service provider” (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<\/p>\n<p>Security<\/p>\n<p>Flickr takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nFlickr cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<\/p>\n<p>Data Retention<\/p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.<\/p>\n<p>Data Transfers<\/p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by Flickr or our service providers or affiliates in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient’s participation in the EU- U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nFlickr has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification (which is part of the certification of our parent company, SmugMug, Inc.), please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in this Privacy Policy, the JAMS mechanism is available only to individuals whose personal data we receive pursuant to Privacy Shield.<\/p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nFlickr, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not Flickr) are responsible for their transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Your Choices<\/p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users’ Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<\/p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos that a Flickr user uploaded to or created in the Services, or any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that the same user added to those images and videos in the Services (Photographer Personal Data), please contact that user directly.\nFlickr processes this data on behalf of the user, and the user has responsibility for handling these requests.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, Flickr is the user’s “processor” of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Flickr is the user’s “service provider” for this data.\n(Flickr still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported as described here.)<\/p>\n<p>Flickr users can follow the instructions below to handle privacy requests or to otherwise manage their Photographer Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>Deleting Photos<\/p>\n<p>You can delete individual photos that you have on Flickr by selecting the photos that you wish to delete, then clicking the delete button.\nOr you can delete groups of photos using batch operations.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Sharing Features<\/p>\n<p>In the \"Privacy &amp.\nPermissions\" section of your Account Settings, you can determine who can see, download, or interact with your content by default.\nYou can control at a more granular level who can see each individual image or video by editing that item’s viewing privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Account Information<\/p>\n<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your online account or contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nYou may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and Permissions Settings<\/p>\n<p>In your account “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab under “Settings”, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your “screen name”) that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>EXIF Information<\/p>\n<p>By default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &amp.\nmodel of the camera you used to take the shot.\nYou can elect to hide this link in “Settings” under the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo’s EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis setting can be changed through your account “Privacy and Permissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Location Information<\/p>\n<p>When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application’s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis default display setting can be changed in the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” Settings in your account.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Geofences<\/p>\n<p>A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings.\nThese are useful for locations such as “home” or “school” that you would like to make more private than your global default.\nClick here to create your geofences and manage your geo preferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default.\nFurther, you can change the geo preferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.<\/p>\n<p>Auto-Uploadr Feature<\/p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature on mobile, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to Flickr.\nThese photos and videos will be stored as private (non-public) on Flickr until you choose to share them.\nYou can turn off auto-upload at any time in your mobile app settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above for options for controlling cookies and similar technology.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional Communications<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Flickr by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.<\/p>\n<p>Email Notifications<\/p>\n<p>Visit the “Emails and Notifications” area in your account Settings to edit your Flickr email notification settings.<\/p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<\/p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<\/p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Every individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<\/p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: Flickr Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<\/p>\n<p>UK: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd., Attn: Flickr Inc., 16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2B 5AH, United Kingdom<br> www.dp-dock.com<br> flickr@gdpr-rep.com<\/p>\n<p>Additional Privacy Details for California Residents<\/p>\n<p>The sections below apply to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<\/p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<\/p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA “sale” of California personal information<\/p>\n<p>Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.\nIn the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.\nHowever, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.\nRegardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<\/p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete certain information we have about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.\nYou can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.\n(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nSimilar exceptions are common in other laws.)<\/p>\n<p>To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.\nAlternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.\nNo other requests are accepted at that number.<\/p>\n<p>Contact Us<\/p>\n<p>We welcome your feedback.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or would like to contact us for any reason, you may reach us via email at help@flickr.com or write to:<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Attention: Privacy Manager<\/p>\n<p>67 E Evelyn Ave, Ste 200<\/p>\n<p>Mountain View, CA 94041,

Last Revision: November 23, 2020<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\n(\"Flickr\") is passionately committed to the privacy of our customers.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to create consistent standards for all of our users.\nThis agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Flickr collects, uses and discloses information from and about you when you use the Flickr services, including the Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications and Flickr website (collectively, the \"Services\").\nIt does not cover data relating to the SmugMug service.<\/p>\n<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, if the changes are significant, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\nWe encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.<\/p>\n<p>For information about how to change your privacy settings, please see: https://help.flickr.com/en_us/change-your-privacy-settings-rygl6XoJm.<\/p>\n<p>Collection of Information<\/p>\n<p>Information You Provide to Us<\/p>\n<p>We collect information you provide directly to us.\nFor example, we collect information when you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create an account and subscribe to our digital photography, media hosting or other services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Purchase photo prints or other products or services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact us for any reason, such as to request help with the Services or to provide us with your comments/feedback.\nor<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Post information in connection with your photos (e.g., in a photo caption) or in other forums or interactive areas of the Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Otherwise communicate with Flickr.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, fax number, credit card information, bank transfer information, title, gender, and other information you choose to provide.<\/p>\n<p>You have the option of telling us how you wish to be identified in connection with your photos, comments and elsewhere using the Services.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your \"nickname\") that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services<\/p>\n<p>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about your use of the Services, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log Information: We log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, screen resolution, color and depth, device identifiers and mobile network information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Location Information: With your consent, we may collect information about the location of your device.\nFor example, we use your location information to provide you with the option to add POI data to your photo.\nFor more details, please see \"Your Choices\" below.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo Location Information: When you upload a photo with geographical data (i.e.\nfrom a mobile device) or manually geotag your photo, we collect the location of that photo.\nWith your consent, we collect information about your location if you take a photo within the Flickr mobile application to add to your photo’s metadata.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>EXIF Data: Exchangeable Image File Format (“EXIF”) data is a record of the settings and other relevant metadata inserted by a digital camera when you take a photo or video such as camera type, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and location (as described above), among other information.\nUnless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr, Flickr receives and stores EXIF data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Object and Scene Type Recognition Technology<\/p>\n<p>We use image recognition algorithms to find visually similar images as well as to help you organize your photos and make it easier to search images.\nThis technology might identify and tag scenes, actions, objects.<\/p>\n<p>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies<\/p>\n<p>We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons and similar technologies.\nCookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to provide and improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits, and for our advertising and analytics purposes.\nWe use cookies to keep you logged in to the Services, to count the number of unique computers using the Services and to record your user preferences.\nWe may also collect information using web beacons (also known as \"tracking pixels\").\nWeb beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.\nYou may be able to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent.\nSome browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage, and Flash storage can be managed here.\nFor more information and more detailed options, please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section below.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect From Other Sources<\/p>\n<p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.\nFor example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.\nWe may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with our billing for the Services.\nWhen somebody buys a gift for you on our service, we’ll receive your shipping information from the purchaser.\nUsers also can share another person’s email address with us through features that can invite the other person to view the user’s content.<\/p>\n<p>Use of Information<\/p>\n<p>Our use of the following information, which we call “Photographer Personal Data,” is limited by our agreements with our registered users: (i) images and videos that the user uploads to or creates in the Services, and (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services.<\/p>\n<p>We use other information for the following purposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze, personalize and improve our Services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To provide the products and Services you order;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To respond to questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To facilitate contests, sweepstakes and surveys;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To comply with law and legal process and protect rights, safety and property.\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>For other purposes requested or permitted by our users or other relevant individuals, such as website visitors.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We also may use personal information to create appropriately aggregated or anonymized data, which is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and which we may use or disclose for any purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing of Information<\/p>\n<p>We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Flickr or others;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In connection with, or in anticipation of, any merger, divestiture, consolidation, bankruptcy, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company, or other significant corporate event (in which case the acquiring entity may use the information pursuant to its own privacy policies and procedures, to the extent legally permissible).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.<\/p>\n<p>Our sharing of Photographer Personal Data is governed by our agreement with the user who posted it.\nIf you contact us regarding a request or complaint about Photographer Personal Data, we may forward your communication to the user who posted it.<\/p>\n<p>Social Sharing Features and Third-Party Integrations<\/p>\n<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, the public, and others, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature, and depending on that entity’s other sharing practices.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may give certain third-party apps different levels of permissions to interact with your account to take advantage of things like photo editing tools.\nIf you want to stop using one of these apps and revoke your permission, click the \"Remove Permission\" link under \"Sharing &amp.\nExtending\" on your account page and remove that permission.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others<\/p>\n<p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.\nThese entities may use cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.\nThis information may be used by Flickr and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nFor more information about interest-based-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices from each browser that you use to access our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google’s collection or use of your data for ad personalization purposes in any particular browser there or at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences.\nYou also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on in each browser.\nYour device should also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<\/p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customer service;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving business activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing risks and legal issues.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\nFor example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We process a user’s Photographer Personal Data as the user’s “processor” (under the GDPR and similar laws) or “service provider” (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<\/p>\n<p>Security<\/p>\n<p>Flickr takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nFlickr cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<\/p>\n<p>Data Retention<\/p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.<\/p>\n<p>Data Transfers<\/p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by Flickr or our service providers or affiliates in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient’s participation in the EU- U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nFlickr has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification (which is part of the certification of our parent company, SmugMug, Inc.), please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in this Privacy Policy, the JAMS mechanism is available only to individuals whose personal data we receive pursuant to Privacy Shield.<\/p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nFlickr, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not Flickr) are responsible for their transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Your Choices<\/p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users’ Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<\/p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos that a Flickr user uploaded to or created in the Services, or any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that the same user added to those images and videos in the Services (Photographer Personal Data), please contact that user directly.\nFlickr processes this data on behalf of the user, and the user has responsibility for handling these requests.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, Flickr is the user’s “processor” of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Flickr is the user’s “service provider” for this data.\n(Flickr still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported as described here.)<\/p>\n<p>Flickr users can follow the instructions below to handle privacy requests or to otherwise manage their Photographer Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>Deleting Photos<\/p>\n<p>You can delete individual photos that you have on Flickr by selecting the photos that you wish to delete, then clicking the delete button.\nOr you can delete groups of photos using batch operations.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Sharing Features<\/p>\n<p>In the \"Privacy &amp.\nPermissions\" section of your Account Settings, you can determine who can see, download, or interact with your content by default.\nYou can control at a more granular level who can see each individual image or video by editing that item’s viewing privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Account Information<\/p>\n<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your online account or contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nYou may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and Permissions Settings<\/p>\n<p>In your account “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab under “Settings”, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your “screen name”) that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>EXIF Information<\/p>\n<p>By default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &amp.\nmodel of the camera you used to take the shot.\nYou can elect to hide this link in “Settings” under the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo’s EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis setting can be changed through your account “Privacy and Permissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Location Information<\/p>\n<p>When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application’s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis default display setting can be changed in the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” Settings in your account.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Geofences<\/p>\n<p>A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings.\nThese are useful for locations such as “home” or “school” that you would like to make more private than your global default.\nClick here to create your geofences and manage your geo preferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default.\nFurther, you can change the geo preferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.<\/p>\n<p>Auto-Uploadr Feature<\/p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature on mobile, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to Flickr.\nThese photos and videos will be stored as private (non-public) on Flickr until you choose to share them.\nYou can turn off auto-upload at any time in your mobile app settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above for options for controlling cookies and similar technology.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional Communications<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Flickr by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.<\/p>\n<p>Email Notifications<\/p>\n<p>Visit the “Emails and Notifications” area in your account Settings to edit your Flickr email notification settings.<\/p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<\/p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<\/p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Every individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<\/p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: Flickr Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<\/p>\n<p>UK: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd., Attn: Flickr Inc., 16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2B 5AH, United Kingdom<br> www.dp-dock.com<br> flickr@gdpr-rep.com<\/p>\n<p>Additional Privacy Details for California Residents<\/p>\n<p>The sections below apply to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<\/p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<\/p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA “sale” of California personal information<\/p>\n<p>Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.\nIn the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.\nHowever, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.\nRegardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<\/p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete certain information we have about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.\nYou can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.\n(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nSimilar exceptions are common in other laws.)<\/p>\n<p>To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.\nAlternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.\nNo other requests are accepted at that number.<\/p>\n<p>Contact Us<\/p>\n<p>We welcome your feedback.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or would like to contact us for any reason,

Exchangeable Image File Format (“EXIF”) data is a record of the settings and other relevant metadata inserted by a digital camera when you take a photo or video such as camera type, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and location (as described above), among other information.\nUnless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr,

collect through our Services.\nFor example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.\nWe may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with our billing for the Services.\nWhen somebody buys a gift for you on our service, we’ll receive your shipping information from the purchaser.\nUsers also can share another person’s email address with us through features that can invite the other person to view the user’s content.<\/p>\n<p>Use of Information<\/p>\n<p>Our use of the following information, which we call “Photographer Personal Data,” is limited by our agreements with our registered users: (i) images and videos that the user uploads to or creates in the Services, and (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services.<\/p>\n<p>We use other information for the following

this Privacy Policy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Flickr or others;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In connection with, or in anticipation of, any merger, divestiture, consolidation, bankruptcy, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of

particular manner and you provide such information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.<\/p>\n<p>Our sharing of Photographer Personal Data is governed by our agreement with the user who posted it.\nIf you contact us regarding a request or complaint about Photographer Personal Data, we may forward your

share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, the public, and others, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature, and depending on that entity’s other sharing practices.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may give certain third-party apps different levels of permissions to interact with your account to take advantage of things like photo editing tools.\nIf you want to stop using one of these apps and revoke your permission, click the \"Remove Permission\" link under \"Sharing &amp.\nExtending\" on your account page and remove that permission.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others<\/p>\n<p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.\nThese entities may use cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked

browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices from each browser that you use to access our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google’s collection or use of your data for ad personalization purposes in any particular browser there or at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences.\nYou also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on in each browser.\nYour device should also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<\/p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customer service;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving business activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing risks and legal issues.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\nFor example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We process a user’s Photographer Personal Data as the user’s “processor” (under the GDPR and similar laws) or “service provider” (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<\/p>\n<p>Security<\/p>\n<p>Flickr takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nFlickr cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<\/p>\n<p>Data Retention<\/p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.<\/p>\n<p>Data Transfers<\/p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by Flickr or our service providers or affiliates in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient’s participation in the EU- U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nFlickr has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification (which is part of the certification of our parent company, SmugMug, Inc.), please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in this Privacy Policy, the JAMS mechanism is available only to individuals whose personal data we receive pursuant to Privacy Shield.<\/p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nFlickr, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not Flickr) are responsible for their transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Your Choices<\/p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users’ Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<\/p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos that a Flickr user uploaded to or created in the Services, or any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that the same user added to those images and videos in the Services (Photographer Personal Data), please contact that user directly.\nFlickr processes this data on behalf of the user, and the user has responsibility for handling these requests.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, Flickr is the user’s “processor” of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Flickr is the user’s “service provider” for this data.\n(Flickr still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported as described here.)<\/p>\n<p>Flickr users can follow the instructions below to handle privacy requests or to otherwise manage their Photographer Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>Deleting Photos<\/p>\n<p>You can delete individual photos that you have on Flickr by selecting the photos that you wish to delete, then clicking the delete button.\nOr you can delete groups of photos using batch operations.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Sharing Features<\/p>\n<p>In the \"Privacy &amp.\nPermissions\" section of your Account Settings, you can determine who can see, download, or interact with your content by default.\nYou can control at a more granular level who can see each individual image or video by editing that item’s viewing privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Account Information<\/p>\n<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your online account or contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nYou may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and Permissions Settings<\/p>\n<p>In your account “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab under “Settings”, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your “screen name”) that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>EXIF Information<\/p>\n<p>By default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &amp.\nmodel of the camera you used to take the shot.\nYou can elect to hide this link in “Settings” under the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo’s EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis setting can be changed through your account “Privacy and Permissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Location Information<\/p>\n<p>When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application’s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis default display setting can be changed in the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” Settings in your account.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Geofences<\/p>\n<p>A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings.\nThese are useful for locations such as “home” or “school” that you would like to make more private than your global default.\nClick here to create your geofences and manage your geo preferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default.\nFurther, you can change the geo preferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.<\/p>\n<p>Auto-Uploadr Feature<\/p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature on mobile, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to Flickr.\nThese photos and videos will be stored as private (non-public) on Flickr until you choose to share them.\nYou can turn off auto-upload at any time in your mobile app settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above for options for controlling cookies and similar technology.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional Communications<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Flickr by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.<\/p>\n<p>Email Notifications<\/p>\n<p>Visit the “Emails and Notifications” area in your account Settings to edit your Flickr email notification settings.<\/p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<\/p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<\/p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Every individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<\/p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: Flickr Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<\/p>\n<p>UK: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd., Attn: Flickr Inc., 16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2B 5AH, United Kingdom<br> www.dp-dock.com<br> flickr@gdpr-rep.com<\/p>\n<p>Additional Privacy Details for California Residents<\/p>\n<p>The sections below apply to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<\/p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<\/p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA “sale” of California personal information<\/p>\n<p>Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.\nIn the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.\nHowever, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.\nRegardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<\/p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete certain information we have about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.\nYou can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.\n(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nSimilar exceptions are common in other laws.)<\/p>\n<p>To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.\nAlternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.\nNo other requests are accepted at that number.<\/p>\n<p>Contact Us<\/p>\n<p>We welcome your feedback.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or would like to contact us for any reason,

other related merchandise, products and services (\"Products\") through Flickr’s approved third party vendors and retailers (\"Flickr Vendors\").<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\nis owned by SmugMug, Inc.\nIn these Terms of Use, the term “SmugMug” refers to Flickr, Inc., together with SmugMug, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries and their respective employees, agents, affiliates and contractors.\nHowever, these Terms of Use do not apply to SmugMug-branded services offered by the SmugMug family of companies.\nPlease see https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms for terms of use applicable to those services.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY.\nBY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR FLICKR PRO SERVICES, OR CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and SmugMug have against each other are resolved (see Section 15 — Dispute Resolution).\nThese provisions

notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new

Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area,

another individual, entity or Flickr user unless such transfer or assignment is expressly permitted by the terms of your Subscription Plan.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, Flickr may provide certain users

YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your

cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO

appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination,

Last Revision: November 23, 2020<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\n(\"Flickr\") is passionately committed to the privacy of our customers.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to create consistent standards for all of our users.\nThis agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Flickr collects, uses and discloses information from and about you when you use the Flickr services, including the Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications and Flickr website (collectively, the \"Services\").\nIt does not cover data relating to the SmugMug service.<\/p>\n<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, if the changes are significant, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\nWe encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.<\/p>\n<p>For information about how to change your privacy settings, please see:

us.\nFor example, we collect information when you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create an account and subscribe to our digital photography, media hosting or other services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Purchase photo prints or other products or services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact us for any reason, such as to request help with the Services or to provide us with your comments/feedback.\nor<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Post information in connection with your photos (e.g., in a photo caption) or in other forums or interactive areas of the Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Otherwise communicate with Flickr.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, fax number, credit card information, bank transfer information, title, gender, and other information you choose to provide.<\/p>\n<p>You have the option of telling us how you wish to be identified in connection with your photos, comments and elsewhere using the Services.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your \"nickname\") that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services<\/p>\n<p>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about your use of the Services, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log Information: We log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, screen resolution, color and depth, device identifiers and mobile network information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Location Information: With your consent, we may collect information about the location of your device.\nFor example, we use your location information to provide you with the option to add POI data to your photo.\nFor more details, please see \"Your Choices\" below.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo Location Information: When you upload a photo with geographical data (i.e.\nfrom a mobile device) or manually geotag your photo, we collect the location of that photo.\nWith your consent, we collect information about your location if you take a photo within the Flickr mobile application to add to your photo’s metadata.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>EXIF Data: Exchangeable Image File Format (“EXIF”) data is a record of the settings and other relevant metadata inserted by a digital camera when you take a photo or video such as camera type, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and location (as described above), among other information.\nUnless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr, Flickr receives and stores EXIF data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Object and Scene Type Recognition Technology<\/p>\n<p>We use image recognition algorithms to find visually similar images as well as to help you organize your photos and make it easier to search images.\nThis technology might identify and tag scenes, actions, objects.<\/p>\n<p>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies<\/p>\n<p>We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons and similar technologies.\nCookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to provide and improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits, and for our advertising and analytics purposes.\nWe use cookies to keep you logged in to the Services, to count the number of unique computers using the Services and to record your user preferences.\nWe may also collect information using web beacons (also known as \"tracking pixels\").\nWeb beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.\nYou may be able to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent.\nSome browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage, and Flash storage can be managed here.\nFor more information and more detailed options, please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section below.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect From Other Sources<\/p>\n<p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.\nFor example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.\nWe may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with our billing for the Services.\nWhen somebody buys a gift for you on our service, we’ll receive your shipping information from the purchaser.\nUsers also can share another person’s email address with us through features that can invite the other person to view the user’s content.<\/p>\n<p>Use of Information<\/p>\n<p>Our use of the following information, which we call “Photographer Personal Data,” is limited by our agreements with our registered users: (i) images and videos that the user uploads to or creates in the Services, and (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services.<\/p>\n<p>We use other information for the following purposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze, personalize and improve our Services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To provide the products and Services you order;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To respond to questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To facilitate contests, sweepstakes and surveys;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To comply with law and legal process and protect rights, safety and property.\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>For other purposes requested or permitted by our users or other relevant individuals, such as website visitors.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We also may use personal information to create appropriately aggregated or anonymized data, which is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and which we may use or disclose for any purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing of Information<\/p>\n<p>We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Flickr or others;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In connection with, or in anticipation of, any merger, divestiture, consolidation, bankruptcy, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company, or other significant corporate event (in which case the acquiring entity may use the information pursuant to its own privacy policies and procedures, to the extent legally permissible).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.<\/p>\n<p>Our sharing of Photographer Personal Data is governed by our agreement with the user who posted it.\nIf you contact us regarding a request or complaint about Photographer Personal Data, we may forward your communication to the user who posted it.<\/p>\n<p>Social Sharing Features and Third-Party Integrations<\/p>\n<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, the public, and others, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature, and depending on that entity’s other sharing practices.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may give certain third-party apps different levels of permissions to interact with your account to take advantage of things like photo editing tools.\nIf you want to stop using one of these apps and revoke your permission, click the \"Remove Permission\" link under \"Sharing &amp.\nExtending\" on your account page and remove that permission.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others<\/p>\n<p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.\nThese entities may use cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.\nThis information may be used by Flickr and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nFor more information about interest-based-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices from each browser that you use to access our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google’s collection or use of your data for ad personalization purposes in any particular browser there or at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences.\nYou also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on in each browser.\nYour device should also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<\/p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customer service;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving business activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing risks and legal issues.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\nFor example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We process a user’s Photographer Personal Data as the user’s “processor” (under the GDPR and similar laws) or “service provider” (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<\/p>\n<p>Security<\/p>\n<p>Flickr takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nFlickr cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<\/p>\n<p>Data Retention<\/p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.<\/p>\n<p>Data Transfers<\/p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by Flickr or our service providers or affiliates in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient’s participation in the EU- U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nFlickr has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification (which is part of the certification of our parent company, SmugMug, Inc.), please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in this Privacy Policy, the JAMS mechanism is available only to individuals whose personal data we receive pursuant to Privacy Shield.<\/p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nFlickr, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not Flickr) are responsible for their transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Your Choices<\/p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users’ Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<\/p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos that a Flickr user uploaded to or created in the Services, or any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that the same user added to those images and videos in the Services (Photographer Personal Data), please contact that user directly.\nFlickr processes this data on behalf of the user, and the user has responsibility for handling these requests.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, Flickr is the user’s “processor” of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Flickr is the user’s “service provider” for this data.\n(Flickr still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported as described here.)<\/p>\n<p>Flickr users can follow the instructions below to handle privacy requests or to otherwise manage their Photographer Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>Deleting Photos<\/p>\n<p>You can delete individual photos that you have on Flickr by selecting the photos that you wish to delete, then clicking the delete button.\nOr you can delete groups of photos using batch operations.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Sharing Features<\/p>\n<p>In the \"Privacy &amp.\nPermissions\" section of your Account Settings, you can determine who can see, download, or interact with your content by default.\nYou can control at a more granular level who can see each individual image or video by editing that item’s viewing privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Account Information<\/p>\n<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your online account or contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nYou may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and Permissions Settings<\/p>\n<p>In your account “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab under “Settings”, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your “screen name”) that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>EXIF Information<\/p>\n<p>By default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &amp.\nmodel of the camera you used to take the shot.\nYou can elect to hide this link in “Settings” under the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo’s EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis setting can be changed through your account “Privacy and Permissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Location Information<\/p>\n<p>When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application’s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis default display setting can be changed in the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” Settings in your account.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Geofences<\/p>\n<p>A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings.\nThese are useful for locations such as “home” or “school” that you would like to make more private than your global default.\nClick here to create your geofences and manage your geo preferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default.\nFurther, you can change the geo preferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.<\/p>\n<p>Auto-Uploadr Feature<\/p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature on mobile, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to Flickr.\nThese photos and videos will be stored as private (non-public) on Flickr until you choose to share them.\nYou can turn off auto-upload at any time in your mobile app settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above for options for controlling cookies and similar technology.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional Communications<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Flickr by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.<\/p>\n<p>Email Notifications<\/p>\n<p>Visit the “Emails and Notifications” area in your account Settings to edit your Flickr email notification settings.<\/p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<\/p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<\/p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Every individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<\/p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: Flickr Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<\/p>\n<p>UK: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd., Attn: Flickr Inc., 16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2B 5AH, United Kingdom<br> www.dp-dock.com<br> flickr@gdpr-rep.com<\/p>\n<p>Additional Privacy Details for California Residents<\/p>\n<p>The sections below apply to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<\/p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<\/p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA “sale” of California personal information<\/p>\n<p>Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.\nIn the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.\nHowever, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.\nRegardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<\/p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete certain information we have about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.\nYou can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.\n(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nSimilar exceptions are common in other laws.)<\/p>\n<p>To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.\nAlternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.\nNo other requests are accepted at that number.<\/p>\n<p>Contact Us<\/p>\n<p>We welcome your feedback.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or would like to contact us for any reason, you may reach us via email at help@flickr.com or write to:<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Attention: Privacy Manager<\/p>\n<p>67 E Evelyn Ave, Ste 200<\/p>\n<p>Mountain View, CA 94041,

Inc.\n(\"Flickr\") is passionately committed to the privacy of our customers.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to create consistent standards for all of our users.\nThis agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Flickr collects, uses and discloses information from and about you when you use the Flickr services, including the Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications and Flickr website (collectively, the \"Services\").\nIt does not cover data relating to the SmugMug service.<\/p>\n<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, if the changes are significant, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\nWe encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.<\/p>\n<p>For information about how to change your privacy settings, please see: https://help.flickr.com/en_us/change-your-privacy-settings-rygl6XoJm.<\/p>\n<p>Collection of Information<\/p>\n<p>Information You Provide to Us<\/p>\n<p>We collect information you provide directly to us.\nFor example, we collect information when you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create an account and subscribe to our digital photography, media hosting or other services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Purchase photo prints or other products or services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact us for any reason, such as to request help with the Services or to provide us with your comments/feedback.\nor<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Post information in connection with your photos (e.g., in a photo caption) or in other forums or interactive areas of the Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Otherwise communicate with Flickr.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, fax number, credit card information, bank transfer information, title, gender, and other information you choose to provide.<\/p>\n<p>You have the option of telling us how you wish to be identified in connection with your photos, comments and elsewhere using the Services.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your \"nickname\") that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services<\/p>\n<p>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about your use of the Services, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log Information: We log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, screen resolution, color and depth, device identifiers and mobile network information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Location Information: With your consent, we may collect information about the location of your device.\nFor example, we use your location information to provide you with the option to add POI data to your photo.\nFor more details, please see \"Your Choices\" below.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo Location Information: When you upload a photo with geographical data (i.e.\nfrom a mobile device) or manually geotag your photo, we collect the location of that photo.\nWith your consent, we collect information about your location if you take a photo within the Flickr mobile application to add to your photo’s metadata.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>EXIF Data: Exchangeable Image File Format (“EXIF”) data is a record of the settings and other relevant metadata inserted by a digital camera when you take a photo or video such as camera type, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and location (as described above), among other information.\nUnless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr, Flickr receives and stores EXIF data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Object and Scene Type Recognition Technology<\/p>\n<p>We use image recognition algorithms to find visually similar images as well as to help you organize your photos and make it easier to search images.\nThis technology might identify and tag scenes, actions, objects.<\/p>\n<p>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies<\/p>\n<p>We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons and similar technologies.\nCookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to provide and improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits, and for our advertising and analytics purposes.\nWe use cookies to keep you logged in to the Services, to count the number of unique computers using the Services and to record your user preferences.\nWe may also collect information using web beacons (also known as \"tracking pixels\").\nWeb beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.\nYou may be able to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent.\nSome browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage, and Flash storage can be managed here.\nFor more information and more detailed options, please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section below.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect From Other Sources<\/p>\n<p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.\nFor example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.\nWe may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with our billing for the Services.\nWhen somebody buys a gift for you on our service, we’ll receive your shipping information from the purchaser.\nUsers also can share another person’s email address with us through features that can invite the other person to view the user’s content.<\/p>\n<p>Use of Information<\/p>\n<p>Our use of the following information, which we call “Photographer Personal Data,” is limited by our agreements with our registered users: (i) images and videos that the user uploads to or creates in the Services, and (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services.<\/p>\n<p>We use other information for the following purposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze, personalize and improve our Services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To provide the products and Services you order;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To respond to questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To facilitate contests, sweepstakes and surveys;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To comply with law and legal process and protect rights, safety and property.\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>For other purposes requested or permitted by our users or other relevant individuals, such as website visitors.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We also may use personal information to create appropriately aggregated or anonymized data, which is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and which we may use or disclose for any purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing of Information<\/p>\n<p>We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Flickr or others;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In connection with, or in anticipation of, any merger, divestiture, consolidation, bankruptcy, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company, or other significant corporate event (in which case the acquiring entity may use the information pursuant to its own privacy policies and procedures, to the extent legally permissible).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.<\/p>\n<p>Our sharing of Photographer Personal Data is governed by our agreement with the user who posted it.\nIf you contact us regarding a request or complaint about Photographer Personal Data, we may forward your communication to the user who posted it.<\/p>\n<p>Social Sharing Features and Third-Party Integrations<\/p>\n<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, the public, and others, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature, and depending on that entity’s other sharing practices.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may give certain third-party apps different levels of permissions to interact with your account to take advantage of things like photo editing tools.\nIf you want to stop using one of these apps and revoke your permission, click the \"Remove Permission\" link under \"Sharing &amp.\nExtending\" on your account page and remove that permission.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others<\/p>\n<p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.\nThese entities may use cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.\nThis information may be used by Flickr and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nFor more information about interest-based-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices from each browser that you use to access our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google’s collection or use of your data for ad personalization purposes in any particular browser there or at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences.\nYou also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on in each browser.\nYour device should also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<\/p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customer service;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving business activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing risks and legal issues.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\nFor example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We process a user’s Photographer Personal Data as the user’s “processor” (under the GDPR and similar laws) or “service provider” (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<\/p>\n<p>Security<\/p>\n<p>Flickr takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nFlickr cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<\/p>\n<p>Data Retention<\/p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.<\/p>\n<p>Data Transfers<\/p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by Flickr or our service providers or affiliates in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient’s participation in the EU- U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nFlickr has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification (which is part of the certification of our parent company, SmugMug, Inc.), please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in this Privacy Policy, the JAMS mechanism is available only to individuals whose personal data we receive pursuant to Privacy Shield.<\/p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nFlickr, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not Flickr) are responsible for their transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Your Choices<\/p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users’ Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<\/p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos that a Flickr user uploaded to or created in the Services, or any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that the same user added to those images and videos in the Services (Photographer Personal Data), please contact that user directly.\nFlickr processes this data on behalf of the user, and the user has responsibility for handling these requests.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, Flickr is the user’s “processor” of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Flickr is the user’s “service provider” for this data.\n(Flickr still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported as described here.)<\/p>\n<p>Flickr users can follow the instructions below to handle privacy requests or to otherwise manage their Photographer Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>Deleting Photos<\/p>\n<p>You can delete individual photos that you have on Flickr by selecting the photos that you wish to delete, then clicking the delete button.\nOr you can delete groups of photos using batch operations.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Sharing Features<\/p>\n<p>In the \"Privacy &amp.\nPermissions\" section of your Account Settings, you can determine who can see, download, or interact with your content by default.\nYou can control at a more granular level who can see each individual image or video by editing that item’s viewing privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Account Information<\/p>\n<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your online account or contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nYou may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and Permissions Settings<\/p>\n<p>In your account “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab under “Settings”, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your “screen name”) that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>EXIF Information<\/p>\n<p>By default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &amp.\nmodel of the camera you used to take the shot.\nYou can elect to hide this link in “Settings” under the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo’s EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis setting can be changed through your account “Privacy and Permissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Location Information<\/p>\n<p>When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application’s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis default display setting can be changed in the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” Settings in your account.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Geofences<\/p>\n<p>A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings.\nThese are useful for locations such as “home” or “school” that you would like to make more private than your global default.\nClick here to create your geofences and manage your geo preferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default.\nFurther, you can change the geo preferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.<\/p>\n<p>Auto-Uploadr Feature<\/p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature on mobile, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to Flickr.\nThese photos and videos will be stored as private (non-public) on Flickr until you choose to share them.\nYou can turn off auto-upload at any time in your mobile app settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above for options for controlling cookies and similar technology.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional Communications<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Flickr by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.<\/p>\n<p>Email Notifications<\/p>\n<p>Visit the “Emails and Notifications” area in your account Settings to edit your Flickr email notification settings.<\/p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<\/p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<\/p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Every individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<\/p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: Flickr Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<\/p>\n<p>UK: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd., Attn: Flickr Inc., 16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2B 5AH, United Kingdom<br> www.dp-dock.com<br> flickr@gdpr-rep.com<\/p>\n<p>Additional Privacy Details for California Residents<\/p>\n<p>The sections below apply to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<\/p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<\/p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA “sale” of California personal information<\/p>\n<p>Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.\nIn the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.\nHowever, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.\nRegardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<\/p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete certain information we have about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.\nYou can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.\n(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nSimilar exceptions are common in other laws.)<\/p>\n<p>To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.\nAlternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.\nNo other requests are accepted at that number.<\/p>\n<p>Contact Us<\/p>\n<p>We welcome your feedback.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or would like to contact us for any reason,

notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new

Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area,

you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Trials<\/p>\n<p>When you

another individual, entity or Flickr user unless such transfer or assignment is expressly permitted by the terms of your Subscription Plan.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, Flickr may provide certain users

TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your

cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO

request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour

appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination,

2020<\/p>\n<p>We strive to create consistent standards for all of our users.\nThis agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>As of May 29, 2018, Flickr is owned and operated by Flickr, Inc.\nThese Terms of Use apply to your access to and use of Flickr.com (the “Site”), the official Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications, and the related Flickr services, such as Flickr Pro Services (collectively with the Site and the rest of the foregoing, the “Services”).\nFor example, these Terms of Use apply to your use of the Services to purchase photographic prints, videos or other related merchandise, products and services (\"Products\") through Flickr’s approved third party vendors and retailers (\"Flickr Vendors\").<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\nis owned by SmugMug, Inc.\nIn these Terms of Use, the term “SmugMug” refers to Flickr, Inc., together with SmugMug, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries and their respective employees, agents, affiliates and contractors.\nHowever, these Terms of Use do not apply to SmugMug-branded services offered by the SmugMug family of companies.\nPlease see https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms for terms of use applicable to those services.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY.\nBY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR FLICKR PRO SERVICES, OR CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and SmugMug have against each other are resolved (see Section 15 — Dispute Resolution).\nThese provisions require you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court.\nIf you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your use of the Services (such as your purchase of Products) is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use.\nIf you do not consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use any Services.\nIf you access the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you warrant that you are an authorized representative of such company or entity with the right to bind such company or entity to these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>The Services are not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 16.\nIf you are between the ages of 16 and 18, you may use the Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p> SmugMug reserves the right to change, modify, revise or otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new Services following the posting of the revised Terms of Use or other notice will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.\nOtherwise, any changes or modifications will be effective within thirty (30) days of the posting of the revisions on the Site unless you notify SmugMug within such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop using the Services.\nTherefore, you should review these Terms of Use whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area, the preceding sentence is not intended to constitute your “consent” to any processing of your own personal data for purposes of the GDPR or local ePrivacy legislation, and Flickr will seek such consent separately from these Terms of Use where applicable law requires Flickr to have your consent.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>GENERAL

THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH SMUGMUG AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.\nIF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 15, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES.<\/p>\n<p>You and SmugMug agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Use or relating to the Services, Site or Flickr Materials.\nARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.\nYou and SmugMug agree: (i) to notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises.\n(ii) to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration.\n(iii) that any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California.\nand (iv) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable).\nThe AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org.\nOther than class procedures and remedies described in these Terms of Use, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, you and SmugMug are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for (1) the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents or (2) allegedly criminal conduct under laws of the United States or any state thereof including, but not limited to, criminal laws addressing pornography, exploitation, obscenity, or hate speech.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different SmugMug or Flickr users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same SmugMug or Flickr user to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe arbitrator’s award will be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nYOU AND SMUGMUG AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND SMUGMUG AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).\nANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER SMUGMUG OR FLICKR USERS.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you and SmugMug agree otherwise, in the event that a court decides that any part of this Section 15 is invalid or unenforceable, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and SmugMug must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California.\nThe remainder of the

upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, you may not assign your rights under these Terms of Use without SmugMug’s prior written consent.\nSmugMug will be permitted to assign its rights under these Terms of Use at its sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>International Users<\/p>\n<p>SmugMug is located in the State of California in the United States of America.\nIf you access the Services from a country other than the United States, you agree that your transactions with SmugMug occur in the United States.\nYou

invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect, and, if legally permitted, such offending provision will be replaced with an enforceable provision that as nearly as possible effects the parties’ intent.<\/p>\n<p>Survival<\/p>\n<p>The terms and conditions of these Terms of Use which by their nature are intended to survive termination or expiration of Services (including, but not limited to, Indemnification, Warranty Disclaimer, Dispute Resolution and the Limitation of Liability) will survive any

such user (the “Subscription Plan”).\nIf you wish to purchase a Subscription, we will ask you to provide certain information in order to facilitate such purchase, including your credit card number,

you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Trials<\/p>\n<p>When you

will be the number of days specified by Flickr at the time of your registration for such Free Trial.\nYou need to provide Flickr (or our applicable third party payment processor) with valid Payment

permitted under the user’s applicable Subscription Plan.\nFlickr, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit, suspend or terminate your use of the Flickr Pro Services if Flickr determines that you have violated these Flickr Pro Services Terms or the Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>Each Subscription is personal to the individual Flickr user.\nYou may not transfer or assign your Subscription to another individual, entity or Flickr user unless such transfer or assignment is expressly permitted by the terms of your Subscription Plan.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, Flickr may provide certain users with complimentary Subscriptions.\nAny user accessing the Services by using a free Subscription is bound by the Terms of Use and any applicable terms and conditions of these Flickr Pro Services Terms (including Flickr’s right to terminate or cancel such Subscriptions).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Term and Automatic Renewal<\/p>\n<p>Your Subscription is valid commencing on the date in which Flickr provides you with access to the Services pursuant to its receipt of your valid Payment Information (the “Commencement Date”) and will last for the duration of the Subscription term that you select at the time of your registration for the Flickr Pro Services (the “Subscription Term”).<\/p>\n<p>YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION TERM FOR SUCCESSIVE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS TERMINATED AND/OR CANCELED BY YOU OR FLICKR PRIOR TO THE END OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge at the time of Subscription renewal may differ from the Subscription Fees you originally paid for the Flickr Pro Services if: (i) the Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan changes during your applicable Subscription Term, or (ii) if you change your Subscription Plan or Subscription Term during the previous Subscription Term.\nFlickr will notify you of any changes to the Subscription Fee prior to the date on which your Subscription Term will renew.\nYou hereby agree to any such revised Subscription Fees and your sole remedy if you disagree with such changes is to terminate your account and stop using the Flickr Pro Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Interruptions or Discontinuation of Flickr Pro Services.\nChanges to Flickr Pro Services and Terms of Use<\/p>\n<p>Flickr reserves the right at any time, at its sole discretion and without notice, to suspend, modify, discontinue or permanently cancel the Flickr Pro Services or any portions thereof, including the Subscription Plans and any policies, features and terms applicable thereto.\nIf the Flickr Pro Services, or any part thereof, to which you subscribe are permanently discontinued or canceled by Flickr, your Subscription will terminate, and we will have no further liability to you.\nYou acknowledge that the Flickr Pro Services may be interrupted from time to time, with or without notice, for maintenance, upgrades, system updates or in the event of equipment failure or for any other foreseeable or non-foreseeable cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO ACCESS ANY MEDIA OR MATERIALS ON THE SERVICES.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Termination of Services<\/p>\n<p>You may request the termination of your Subscription at any time by canceling your account in the Subscription section of your Account Settings, or by sending a message through https://help.flickr.com/contact providing clear written notice of such request.\nWhen Flickr receives your termination request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from Flickr.\nIf you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective at the end of any previously paid Subscription Term.\nBy way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, if you request the termination of your Subscription and you have two months remaining in your Subscription Term, such termination is effective at the end of the two months remaining in your Subscription Term and you will have access to the Flickr Pro Services for the remaining two months of such Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr may terminate a Subscription, or any user’s access to and use of the Flickr Pro Services, at any time for any reason at its sole discretion, which such termination will be effective immediately.\nIf you violate the Terms of Use, Flickr at its sole discretion may (i) require you to remedy any violation thereof and/or (ii) take any other actions that Flickr deems appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination, cancellation or discontinuation occurs prior to the expiration of the applicable Subscription Term.<\/p>\n<p>You may change your email, credit card information or other Payment Information for your account by using the Account Settings available in your user profile.\nIt is solely your responsibility to keep your account information and Payment Information accurate and up-to-date.\nIf the

the Services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your use of the Services (such as your purchase of Products) is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use.\nIf you do not consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use any Services.\nIf you access the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you warrant that you are an authorized representative of such company or entity with the right to bind such company or entity to these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>The Services are not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 16.\nIf you are between the

modify, revise or otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new Services following the posting of the revised Terms of Use or other notice will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.\nOtherwise, any changes or modifications will be effective within thirty (30) days of the posting of the revisions on the Site unless you notify SmugMug within such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop using the Services.\nTherefore, you should review these Terms of Use whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area, the preceding sentence is not intended to constitute your “consent” to any processing of your own personal data for purposes of the GDPR or local ePrivacy legislation, and Flickr will seek such consent separately from these Terms of Use where applicable law requires Flickr to have your consent.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>GENERAL TERMS<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Additional

you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Trials<\/p>\n<p>When you first register for the Flickr Pro Services, Flickr may offer you the ability to use the Flickr Pro Services without charge for a limited trial period (a “Free Trial”).\nThe duration of a Free Trial will be the number of days specified by Flickr at the time of your registration for such Free Trial.\nYou need to provide Flickr (or our applicable third party payment processor) with valid Payment Information and select a Subscription Plan in order to register for a Free Trial.\nAt the conclusion of your Free Trial, you will be charged for the Subscription Fee applicable to your selected Subscription Plan unless you elect to cancel your Flickr Pro Services account prior to the expiration of your Free Trial.\nFlickr may offer you the ability to register for a Subscription directly without the need to participate in a Free Trial.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Subscription Plans<\/p>\n<p>Flickr offers a variety of Subscription Plans designed to reflect the diverse needs of our users,

permitted under the user’s applicable Subscription Plan.\nFlickr, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit, suspend or terminate your use of the Flickr Pro Services if Flickr determines that you have violated these Flickr Pro Services Terms or the Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>Each Subscription is personal to the individual Flickr user.\nYou may not transfer or assign your Subscription to another individual, entity or Flickr user unless such transfer or assignment is expressly permitted by the terms of your Subscription Plan.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, Flickr may provide certain users with complimentary Subscriptions.\nAny user accessing the Services by using a free Subscription is bound by the Terms of Use and any applicable terms and conditions of these Flickr Pro Services Terms (including Flickr’s right to terminate or cancel such Subscriptions).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Term and Automatic Renewal<\/p>\n<p>Your Subscription is valid commencing on the date in which Flickr provides you with access to the Services pursuant to its receipt of your valid Payment Information (the “Commencement Date”) and will last for the duration of the Subscription term that you select at the time of your registration for the Flickr Pro Services (the “Subscription Term”).<\/p>\n<p>YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION TERM FOR SUCCESSIVE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS TERMINATED AND/OR CANCELED BY YOU OR FLICKR PRIOR TO THE END OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge at the time of Subscription renewal may differ from the Subscription Fees you originally paid for the Flickr Pro Services if: (i) the Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan changes during your applicable Subscription Term, or (ii) if you change your Subscription Plan or Subscription Term during the previous Subscription Term.\nFlickr will notify you of any changes to the Subscription Fee prior to the date on which your Subscription Term will renew.\nYou hereby agree to any such revised Subscription Fees and your sole remedy if you disagree with such changes is to terminate your account and stop using the Flickr Pro Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Interruptions or Discontinuation of Flickr Pro Services.\nChanges to Flickr Pro Services and Terms of Use<\/p>\n<p>Flickr reserves the right at any time, at its sole discretion and without notice, to suspend, modify, discontinue or permanently cancel the Flickr Pro Services or any portions thereof, including the Subscription Plans and any policies, features and terms applicable thereto.\nIf the Flickr Pro Services, or any part thereof, to which you subscribe are permanently discontinued or canceled by Flickr, your Subscription will terminate, and we will have no further liability to you.\nYou acknowledge that the Flickr Pro Services may be interrupted from time to time, with or without notice, for maintenance, upgrades, system updates or in the event of equipment failure or for any other foreseeable or non-foreseeable cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO ACCESS ANY MEDIA OR MATERIALS ON THE SERVICES.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Termination of Services<\/p>\n<p>You may request the termination of your Subscription at any time by canceling your account in the Subscription section of your Account Settings, or by sending a message through https://help.flickr.com/contact providing clear written notice of such request.\nWhen Flickr receives your termination request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from Flickr.\nIf you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective at the end of any previously paid Subscription Term.\nBy way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, if you request the termination of your Subscription and you have two months remaining in your Subscription Term, such termination is effective at the end of the two months remaining in your Subscription Term and you will have access to the Flickr Pro Services for the remaining two months of such Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr may terminate a Subscription, or any user’s access to and use of the Flickr Pro Services, at any time for any reason at its sole discretion, which such termination will be effective immediately.\nIf you violate the Terms of Use, Flickr at its sole discretion may (i) require you to remedy any violation thereof and/or (ii) take any other actions that Flickr deems appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination, cancellation or discontinuation occurs prior to the expiration of the applicable Subscription Term.<\/p>\n<p>You may change your email, credit card information or other Payment Information for your account by using the Account Settings available in your user profile.\nIt is solely your responsibility to keep your account information and Payment Information accurate and up-to-date.\nIf the

15, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES.<\/p>\n<p>You and SmugMug agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Use or relating to the Services, Site or Flickr

such user (the “Subscription Plan”).\nIf you wish to purchase a Subscription, we will ask you to provide certain information in order to facilitate such purchase, including your credit card number,

you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Trials<\/p>\n<p>When you

that you have violated these Flickr Pro Services Terms or the Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>Each Subscription is personal to the individual Flickr user.\nYou may not transfer or assign your Subscription to another individual, entity or Flickr user unless such transfer or assignment is expressly permitted by the terms of your Subscription Plan.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, Flickr may provide certain users with complimentary Subscriptions.\nAny user accessing the Services by using a free Subscription is bound by the Terms of Use and any applicable terms and conditions of these Flickr Pro Services Terms

provides you with access to the Services pursuant to its receipt of your valid Payment Information (the “Commencement Date”) and will last for the duration of the Subscription term that you select at the time of your registration for the Flickr Pro Services (the “Subscription Term”).<\/p>\n<p>YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION TERM FOR SUCCESSIVE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS TERMINATED AND/OR CANCELED BY YOU OR FLICKR PRIOR TO THE END OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge at the time of Subscription renewal may differ from the Subscription Fees you originally paid for the Flickr Pro Services if: (i) the Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan changes during your applicable Subscription Term, or (ii) if you change your Subscription Plan or Subscription Term during the previous Subscription Term.\nFlickr will notify you of any changes to the Subscription Fee prior to the date on which your Subscription Term will renew.\nYou hereby agree to any such revised Subscription Fees

Services.\nChanges to Flickr Pro Services and Terms of Use<\/p>\n<p>Flickr reserves the right at any time, at its sole discretion and without notice, to suspend, modify, discontinue or permanently cancel the Flickr Pro Services or any portions thereof, including the Subscription Plans and any policies, features and terms applicable thereto.\nIf the Flickr Pro Services, or any part thereof, to which you subscribe are permanently discontinued or canceled by Flickr, your Subscription will terminate, and we will have no further liability to you.\nYou acknowledge that the Flickr Pro Services may be interrupted from time to time, with or without notice, for maintenance, upgrades, system updates or in the event of equipment failure or for any other foreseeable or non-foreseeable cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO

Subscription section of your Account Settings, or by sending a message through https://help.flickr.com/contact providing clear written notice of such request.\nWhen Flickr receives your termination request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from Flickr.\nIf you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective at the end of any previously paid Subscription Term.\nBy way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, if you request the termination of your Subscription and you have two months remaining in your Subscription Term, such termination is effective at the end of the two months remaining in your Subscription Term and you will have access to the Flickr Pro Services for the remaining two months of such Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr may terminate a Subscription, or any user’s access to and use of the Flickr Pro Services, at any time for any reason at its sole discretion, which such termination will be effective immediately.\nIf you violate the Terms of Use, Flickr at its sole discretion may (i) require you to remedy any violation thereof and/or (ii) take any other actions that Flickr deems appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination, cancellation or discontinuation occurs prior to the expiration of the applicable Subscription Term.<\/p>\n<p>You may change your email, credit card information or other Payment Information for your account by using the Account Settings available in your user profile.\nIt is solely your responsibility to keep your account information and Payment Information accurate and up-to-date.\nIf the

Services account for nonpayment.\nIf Flickr does not have a current, working email address for your user account, then you may not receive important notices from us regarding your account, including notices regarding termination.\nFlickr cannot guarantee that you will receive notice of the termination of your account.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Backup Policy<\/p>\n<p>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR

YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable

cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO

request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour

appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination,

of Last Revision: November 23, 2020<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\n(\"Flickr\") is passionately committed to the privacy of our customers.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to create consistent standards for all of our users.\nThis agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Flickr collects, uses and discloses information from and about you when you use the Flickr services, including the Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications and Flickr website (collectively, the \"Services\").\nIt does not cover data relating to the SmugMug service.<\/p>\n<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, if the changes are significant, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\nWe encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.<\/p>\n<p>For information about how to change your privacy settings, please see: https://help.flickr.com/en_us/change-your-privacy-settings-rygl6XoJm.<\/p>\n<p>Collection of Information<\/p>\n<p>Information You Provide to Us<\/p>\n<p>We collect information you provide directly to us.\nFor example, we collect information when you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create an account and subscribe to our digital photography, media hosting or other services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Purchase photo prints or other products or services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact us for any reason, such as to request help with the Services or to provide us with your comments/feedback.\nor<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Post information in connection with your photos (e.g., in a photo caption) or in other forums or interactive areas of the Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Otherwise communicate with Flickr.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, fax number, credit card information, bank transfer information, title, gender, and other information you choose to provide.<\/p>\n<p>You have the option of telling us how you wish to be identified in connection with your photos, comments and elsewhere using the Services.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your \"nickname\") that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services<\/p>\n<p>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about your use of the Services, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log Information: We log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, screen resolution, color and depth, device identifiers and mobile network information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Location Information: With your consent, we may collect information about the location of your device.\nFor example, we use your location information to provide you with the option to add POI data to your photo.\nFor more details, please see \"Your Choices\" below.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo Location Information: When you upload a photo with geographical data (i.e.\nfrom a mobile device) or manually geotag your photo, we collect the location of that photo.\nWith your consent, we collect information about your location if you take a photo within the Flickr mobile application to add to your photo’s metadata.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>EXIF Data: Exchangeable Image File Format (“EXIF”) data is a record of the settings and other relevant metadata inserted by a digital camera when you take a photo or video such as camera type, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and location (as described above), among other information.\nUnless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr, Flickr receives and stores EXIF data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Object and Scene Type Recognition Technology<\/p>\n<p>We use image recognition algorithms to find visually similar images as well as to help you organize your photos and make it easier to search images.\nThis technology might identify and tag scenes, actions, objects.<\/p>\n<p>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies<\/p>\n<p>We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons and similar technologies.\nCookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to provide and improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits, and for our advertising and analytics purposes.\nWe use cookies to keep you logged in to the Services, to count the number of unique computers using the Services and to record your user preferences.\nWe may also collect information using web beacons (also known as \"tracking pixels\").\nWeb beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.\nYou may be able to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent.\nSome browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage, and Flash storage can be managed here.\nFor more information and more detailed options, please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section below.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect From Other Sources<\/p>\n<p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.\nFor example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.\nWe may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with our billing for the Services.\nWhen somebody buys a gift for you on our service, we’ll receive your shipping information from the purchaser.\nUsers also can share another person’s email address with us through features that can invite the other person to view the user’s content.<\/p>\n<p>Use of Information<\/p>\n<p>Our use of the following information, which we call “Photographer Personal Data,” is limited by our agreements with our registered users: (i) images and videos that the user uploads to or creates in the Services, and (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services.<\/p>\n<p>We use other information for the following purposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze, personalize and improve our Services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To provide the products and Services you order;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To respond to questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To facilitate contests, sweepstakes and surveys;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To comply with law and legal process and protect rights, safety and property.\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>For other purposes requested or permitted by our users or other relevant individuals, such as website visitors.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We also may use personal information to create appropriately aggregated or anonymized data, which is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and which we may use or disclose for any purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing of Information<\/p>\n<p>We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Flickr or others;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In connection with, or in anticipation of, any merger, divestiture, consolidation, bankruptcy, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company, or other significant corporate event (in which case the acquiring entity may use the information pursuant to its own privacy policies and procedures, to the extent legally permissible).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.<\/p>\n<p>Our sharing of Photographer Personal Data is governed by our agreement with the user who posted it.\nIf you contact us regarding a request or complaint about Photographer Personal Data, we may forward your communication to the user who posted it.<\/p>\n<p>Social Sharing Features and Third-Party Integrations<\/p>\n<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, the public, and others, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature, and depending on that entity’s other sharing practices.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may give certain third-party apps different levels of permissions to interact with your account to take advantage of things like photo editing tools.\nIf you want to stop using one of these apps and revoke your permission, click the \"Remove Permission\" link under \"Sharing &amp.\nExtending\" on your account page and remove that permission.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others<\/p>\n<p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.\nThese entities may use cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.\nThis information may be used by Flickr and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nFor more information about interest-based-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices from each browser that you use to access our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google’s collection or use of your data for ad personalization purposes in any particular browser there or at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences.\nYou also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on in each browser.\nYour device should also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<\/p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customer service;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving business activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing risks and legal issues.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\nFor example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We process a user’s Photographer Personal Data as the user’s “processor” (under the GDPR and similar laws) or “service provider” (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<\/p>\n<p>Security<\/p>\n<p>Flickr takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nFlickr cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<\/p>\n<p>Data Retention<\/p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.<\/p>\n<p>Data Transfers<\/p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by Flickr or our service providers or affiliates in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient’s participation in the EU- U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nFlickr has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification (which is part of the certification of our parent company, SmugMug, Inc.), please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in this Privacy Policy, the JAMS mechanism is available only to individuals whose personal data we receive pursuant to Privacy Shield.<\/p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nFlickr, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not Flickr) are responsible for their transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Your Choices<\/p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users’ Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<\/p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos that a Flickr user uploaded to or created in the Services, or any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that the same user added to those images and videos in the Services (Photographer Personal Data), please contact that user directly.\nFlickr processes this data on behalf of the user, and the user has responsibility for handling these requests.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, Flickr is the user’s “processor” of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Flickr is the user’s “service provider” for this data.\n(Flickr still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported as described here.)<\/p>\n<p>Flickr users can follow the instructions below to handle privacy requests or to otherwise manage their Photographer Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>Deleting Photos<\/p>\n<p>You can delete individual photos that you have on Flickr by selecting the photos that you wish to delete, then clicking the delete button.\nOr you can delete groups of photos using batch operations.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Sharing Features<\/p>\n<p>In the \"Privacy &amp.\nPermissions\" section of your Account Settings, you can determine who can see, download, or interact with your content by default.\nYou can control at a more granular level who can see each individual image or video by editing that item’s viewing privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Account Information<\/p>\n<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your online account or contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nYou may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and Permissions Settings<\/p>\n<p>In your account “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab under “Settings”, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your “screen name”) that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>EXIF Information<\/p>\n<p>By default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &amp.\nmodel of the camera you used to take the shot.\nYou can elect to hide this link in “Settings” under the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo’s EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis setting can be changed through your account “Privacy and Permissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Location Information<\/p>\n<p>When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application’s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis default display setting can be changed in the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” Settings in your account.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Geofences<\/p>\n<p>A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings.\nThese are useful for locations such as “home” or “school” that you would like to make more private than your global default.\nClick here to create your geofences and manage your geo preferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default.\nFurther, you can change the geo preferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.<\/p>\n<p>Auto-Uploadr Feature<\/p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature on mobile, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to Flickr.\nThese photos and videos will be stored as private (non-public) on Flickr until you choose to share them.\nYou can turn off auto-upload at any time in your mobile app settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above for options for controlling cookies and similar technology.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional Communications<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Flickr by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.<\/p>\n<p>Email Notifications<\/p>\n<p>Visit the “Emails and Notifications” area in your account Settings to edit your Flickr email notification settings.<\/p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<\/p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<\/p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Every individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<\/p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: Flickr Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<\/p>\n<p>UK: DP Data

for California Residents<\/p>\n<p>The sections below apply to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<\/p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<\/p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA “sale” of California personal information<\/p>\n<p>Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.\nIn the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.\nHowever, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.\nRegardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<\/p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete certain information we have about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.\nYou can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.\n(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nSimilar exceptions are common in other laws.)<\/p>\n<p>To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.\nAlternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.\nNo other requests are accepted at that number.<\/p>\n<p>Contact Us<\/p>\n<p>We welcome your feedback.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or would like to contact us for any reason,

November 23, 2020<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\n(\"Flickr\") is passionately committed to the privacy of our customers.<\/p>\n<p>We strive to create consistent standards for all of our users.\nThis agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Flickr collects, uses and discloses information from and about you when you use the Flickr services, including the Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications and Flickr website (collectively, the \"Services\").\nIt does not cover data relating to the SmugMug service.<\/p>\n<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, if the changes are significant, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification).\nWe encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.<\/p>\n<p>For information about how to change your privacy settings, please see:

the Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Otherwise communicate with Flickr.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, fax number, credit card information, bank transfer information, title, gender, and other information you choose to provide.<\/p>\n<p>You have the option of telling us how you wish to be identified in connection with your photos, comments and elsewhere using the Services.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your \"nickname\") that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services<\/p>\n<p>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about your use of the Services, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Log Information: We log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, screen resolution, color and depth, device identifiers and mobile network information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Location Information: With your consent, we may collect information about the location of your device.\nFor example, we use your location information to provide you with the option to add POI data to your photo.\nFor more details, please see \"Your Choices\" below.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo Location Information: When you upload a photo with geographical data (i.e.\nfrom a mobile device) or manually geotag your photo, we collect the location of that photo.\nWith your consent, we collect information about your location if you take a photo within the Flickr mobile application to add to your photo’s metadata.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>EXIF Data: Exchangeable Image File Format (“EXIF”) data is a record of the settings and other relevant metadata inserted by a digital camera when you take a photo or video such as camera type, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and location (as described above), among other information.\nUnless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr, Flickr receives and stores EXIF data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Object and Scene Type Recognition Technology<\/p>\n<p>We use image recognition algorithms to find visually similar images as well as to help you organize your photos and make it easier to search images.\nThis technology might identify and tag scenes, actions, objects.<\/p>\n<p>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies<\/p>\n<p>We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons and similar technologies.\nCookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to provide and improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits, and for our advertising and analytics purposes.\nWe use cookies to keep you logged in to the Services, to count the number of unique computers using the Services and to record your user preferences.\nWe may also collect information using web beacons (also known as \"tracking pixels\").\nWeb beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.\nYou may be able to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent.\nSome browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage, and Flash storage can be managed here.\nFor more information and more detailed options, please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section below.<\/p>\n<p>Information We Collect From Other Sources<\/p>\n<p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.\nFor example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.\nWe may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with our billing for the Services.\nWhen somebody buys a gift for you on our service, we’ll receive your shipping information from the purchaser.\nUsers also can share another person’s email address with us through features that can invite the other person to view the user’s content.<\/p>\n<p>Use of Information<\/p>\n<p>Our use of the following information, which we call “Photographer Personal Data,” is limited by our agreements with our registered users: (i) images and videos that the user uploads to or creates in the Services, and (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services.<\/p>\n<p>We use other information for the following purposes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To analyze, personalize and improve our Services;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To provide the products and Services you order;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To respond to questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To facilitate contests, sweepstakes and surveys;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To enforce the legal terms that govern our business and commercial relationships;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To comply with law and legal process and protect rights, safety and property.\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>For other purposes requested or permitted by our users or other relevant individuals, such as website visitors.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We also may use personal information to create appropriately aggregated or anonymized data, which is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and which we may use or disclose for any purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing of Information<\/p>\n<p>We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Flickr or others;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In connection with, or in anticipation of, any merger, divestiture, consolidation, bankruptcy, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company, or other significant corporate event (in which case the acquiring entity may use the information pursuant to its own privacy policies and procedures, to the extent legally permissible).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.<\/p>\n<p>Our sharing of Photographer Personal Data is governed by our agreement with the user who posted it.\nIf you contact us regarding a request or complaint about Photographer Personal Data, we may forward your communication to the user who posted it.<\/p>\n<p>Social Sharing Features and Third-Party Integrations<\/p>\n<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, the public, and others, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature, and depending on that entity’s other sharing practices.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may give certain third-party apps different levels of permissions to interact with your account to take advantage of things like photo editing tools.\nIf you want to stop using one of these apps and revoke your permission, click the \"Remove Permission\" link under \"Sharing &amp.\nExtending\" on your account page and remove that permission.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others<\/p>\n<p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.\nThese entities may use cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.\nThis information may be used by Flickr and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nFor more information about interest-based-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices from each browser that you use to access our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google’s collection or use of your data for ad personalization purposes in any particular browser there or at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences.\nYou also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on in each browser.\nYour device should also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<\/p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customer service;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving business activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing risks and legal issues.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\nFor example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We process a user’s Photographer Personal Data as the user’s “processor” (under the GDPR and similar laws) or “service provider” (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<\/p>\n<p>Security<\/p>\n<p>Flickr takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nFlickr cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<\/p>\n<p>Data Retention<\/p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.<\/p>\n<p>Data Transfers<\/p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by Flickr or our service providers or affiliates in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient’s participation in the EU- U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nFlickr has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification (which is part of the certification of our parent company, SmugMug, Inc.), please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in this Privacy Policy, the JAMS mechanism is available only to individuals whose personal data we receive pursuant to Privacy Shield.<\/p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nFlickr, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not Flickr) are responsible for their transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Your Choices<\/p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users’ Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<\/p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos that a Flickr user uploaded to or created in the Services, or any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that the same user added to those images and videos in the Services (Photographer Personal Data), please contact that user directly.\nFlickr processes this data on behalf of the user, and the user has responsibility for handling these requests.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, Flickr is the user’s “processor” of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Flickr is the user’s “service provider” for this data.\n(Flickr still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported as described here.)<\/p>\n<p>Flickr users can follow the instructions below to handle privacy requests or to otherwise manage their Photographer Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>Deleting Photos<\/p>\n<p>You can delete individual photos that you have on Flickr by selecting the photos that you wish to delete, then clicking the delete button.\nOr you can delete groups of photos using batch operations.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Sharing Features<\/p>\n<p>In the \"Privacy &amp.\nPermissions\" section of your Account Settings, you can determine who can see, download, or interact with your content by default.\nYou can control at a more granular level who can see each individual image or video by editing that item’s viewing privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Account Information<\/p>\n<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your online account or contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nYou may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and Permissions Settings<\/p>\n<p>In your account “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab under “Settings”, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your “screen name”) that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>EXIF Information<\/p>\n<p>By default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &amp.\nmodel of the camera you used to take the shot.\nYou can elect to hide this link in “Settings” under the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo’s EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis setting can be changed through your account “Privacy and Permissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Location Information<\/p>\n<p>When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application’s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis default display setting can be changed in the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” Settings in your account.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Geofences<\/p>\n<p>A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings.\nThese are useful for locations such as “home” or “school” that you would like to make more private than your global default.\nClick here to create your geofences and manage your geo preferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default.\nFurther, you can change the geo preferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.<\/p>\n<p>Auto-Uploadr Feature<\/p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature on mobile, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to Flickr.\nThese photos and videos will be stored as private (non-public) on Flickr until you choose to share them.\nYou can turn off auto-upload at any time in your mobile app settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above for options for controlling cookies and similar technology.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional Communications<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Flickr by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.<\/p>\n<p>Email Notifications<\/p>\n<p>Visit the “Emails and Notifications” area in your account Settings to edit your Flickr email notification settings.<\/p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<\/p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<\/p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Every individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<\/p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: Flickr Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<\/p>\n<p>UK: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd., Attn: Flickr Inc., 16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2B 5AH, United Kingdom<br> www.dp-dock.com<br> flickr@gdpr-rep.com<\/p>\n<p>Additional Privacy Details for California Residents<\/p>\n<p>The sections below apply to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<\/p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<\/p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA “sale” of California personal information<\/p>\n<p>Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.\nIn the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.\nHowever, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.\nRegardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<\/p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete certain information we have about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.\nYou can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.\n(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nSimilar exceptions are common in other laws.)<\/p>\n<p>To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.\nAlternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.\nNo other requests are accepted at that number.<\/p>\n<p>Contact Us<\/p>\n<p>We welcome your feedback.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or would like to contact us for any reason, you may reach us via email at help@flickr.com or write to:<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Attention: Privacy Manager<\/p>\n<p>67 E Evelyn Ave, Ste 200<\/p>\n<p>Mountain View, CA 94041,

cookies?<\/p>\n<p>Cookies are small strings of characters that can be placed on your computer or mobile device via standard browser techniques that uniquely identifies your browser or device.\nWe may use technologies like cookies, pixels and local storage to deliver, secure, and understand products and services.<\/p>\n<p>What are cookies used for?<\/p>\n<p>Cookies and other technologies allow a site or service to know if your computer or device has visited it before.\nThese technologies can then be used to deliver products and services, help us understand how the site or service is being used, help you navigate between pages efficiently, help remember your preferences, and generally enable and improve your experience in using those services.\nCookies can also help ensure marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.<\/p>\n<p>How long will cookies stay on my device?<\/p>\n<p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a \"persistent\" or \"session\" cookie.\nSession cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing.\nPersistent cookies stay on your computer or mobile device until they expire or are deleted.<\/p>\n<p>First and third party cookies<\/p>\n<p>First-party cookies are cookies that belong to Flickr, third-party cookies are cookies that another party accesses or places on your device through our Service.\nThird-party cookies may be placed on your device by someone providing a service for Flickr, for example to help us understand how our service is being used.\nThird-party cookies may also be placed on your device by our business partners so that they can use them to advertise products and services to you elsewhere on the Internet.\nThese companies’ use of cookies and similar technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Flickr Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Why does Flickr use cookies and similar technologies?<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies, pixels, local storage, and similar technologies to show you relevant content, improve your experience, and help protect Flickr and our users.\nWe may use these technologies to deliver the service, provide you with a service that is easy to use, enable you to move around the Service and use its features, such as accessing secure areas, and storing information so that Flickr can respond faster.\nWe may use these technologies to collect information about how you use the Service, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get error messages from certain pages.\nWe may use these technologies to allow us to remember choices you make (such as your user name, the currency you wish to view purchases in or content you have provided access credentials to) and tailor the Service to provide enhanced features and content for you.\nFlickr or our advertising partners may use these technologies to deliver advertising that is relevant to your interests, for example if you are already a Flickr customer, they could be used to not show you advertisements to join Flickr.\nThese technologies can remember that your device has visited a site or service, and may also be able to track your device's browsing activity on other sites or services other than Flickr which also make use of the services of these third parties.\nThis information may be shared with organizations outside Flickr, such as advertisers and/or advertising networks to deliver the advertising, and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.\nWe may use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products and services.<\/p>\n<p>The cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Category of Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Why we use these cookies<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Technical/Required<\/p>\n<p>These cookies are essential for our services to function properly.\nLike the other cookies we use, technical cookies may be either first-party cookies or third-party cookies.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Preferences<\/p>\n<p>We use these cookies to remember your settings and preferences.\nFor example, we may use these cookies to remember your language preferences.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Performance<\/p>\n<p>We use these cookies to collect information about how you interact with our services and to help us improve them.\nFor example, we may use these cookies to determine if you have interacted with a certain page.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analytics<\/p>\n<p>We use these cookies to help us understand and improve our services.For example, we can use these cookies to learn more about which features are the most popular with our users and where we may need to make improvements.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Advertising<\/p>\n<p>We and our advertising partners use these cookies to deliver advertisements, to make them more relevant and meaningful to visitors to our website, and to track the efficiency of our advertising campaigns.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>How to control cookies or other collection mechanisms<\/p>\n<p>Follow the instructions provided by your browser or mobile device (usually located within the \"Help\", \"Tools\" or \"Edit\" facility) to modify your cookie settings.\nPlease be advised that if you set your browser to disable cookies or other technologies, you may not be able to access certain parts of our Service and other parts of our Service will not work properly.\nIn addition, you have other choices with respect to how cookies are used:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install Google’s opt-out browser add-on.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>For information on how our advertising partners allow you to opt out of receiving ads based on your web browsing history, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info.\nEuropean users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising through the

Exchangeable Image File Format (“EXIF”) data is a record of the settings and other relevant metadata inserted by a digital camera when you take a photo or video such as camera type, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and location (as described above), among other information.\nUnless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr, Flickr receives and stores EXIF data.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Object and Scene Type Recognition Technology<\/p>\n<p>We use image recognition algorithms to find visually similar images as well as to

Technologies<\/p>\n<p>We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons and similar technologies.\nCookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to provide and improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits, and for our advertising and analytics purposes.\nWe use cookies to keep you logged in to the Services, to count the number of unique computers using the Services and to record your user preferences.\nWe may also collect information using web beacons (also known as \"tracking pixels\").\nWeb beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.\nYou may be able to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies

collect through our Services.\nFor example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.\nWe may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with our billing for the Services.\nWhen somebody buys a gift for you on our service, we’ll receive your shipping information from

legally permissible).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>With your consent or at your direction, including if we notify you through our Services that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.<\/p>\n<p>Our sharing of Photographer Personal Data is governed by our agreement with the user who posted it.\nIf you contact us regarding a request or complaint about Photographer Personal Data, we may forward your communication to the user who posted it.<\/p>\n<p>Social Sharing Features and Third-Party Integrations<\/p>\n<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, the public, and others, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature, and depending on that entity’s other sharing practices.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may give certain third-party apps different levels of permissions to interact with your account to take advantage of things like photo editing tools.\nIf you want to stop using one of these apps and revoke your permission, click the \"Remove Permission\" link under \"Sharing &amp.\nExtending\" on your account page and remove that permission.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others<\/p>\n<p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.\nThese entities may use cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.\nThis information may be used by Flickr and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nFor more information about interest-based-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices from each browser that you use to access our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google’s collection or use of your data for ad personalization purposes in any particular browser there or at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences.\nYou also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on in each browser.\nYour device should also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<\/p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customer service;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving business activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing risks and legal issues.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\nFor example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We process a user’s Photographer Personal Data as the user’s “processor” (under the GDPR and similar laws) or “service provider” (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<\/p>\n<p>Security<\/p>\n<p>Flickr takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nFlickr cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<\/p>\n<p>Data Retention<\/p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.<\/p>\n<p>Data Transfers<\/p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by Flickr or our service providers or affiliates in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient’s participation in the EU- U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nFlickr has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification (which is part of the certification of our parent company, SmugMug, Inc.), please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in this Privacy Policy, the JAMS mechanism is available only to individuals whose personal data we receive pursuant to Privacy Shield.<\/p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nFlickr, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not Flickr) are responsible for their transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Your Choices<\/p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users’ Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<\/p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos that a Flickr user uploaded to or created in the Services, or any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that the same user added to those images and videos in the Services (Photographer Personal Data), please contact that user directly.\nFlickr processes this data on behalf of the user, and the user has responsibility for handling these requests.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, Flickr is the user’s “processor” of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Flickr is the user’s “service provider” for this data.\n(Flickr still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported as described here.)<\/p>\n<p>Flickr users can follow the instructions below to handle privacy requests or to otherwise manage their Photographer Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>Deleting Photos<\/p>\n<p>You can delete individual photos that you have on Flickr by selecting the photos that you wish to delete, then clicking the delete button.\nOr you can delete groups of photos using batch operations.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Sharing Features<\/p>\n<p>In the \"Privacy &amp.\nPermissions\" section of your Account Settings, you can determine who can see, download, or interact with your content by default.\nYou can control at a more granular level who can see each individual image or video by editing that item’s viewing privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Account Information<\/p>\n<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your online account or contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nYou may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and Permissions Settings<\/p>\n<p>In your account “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab under “Settings”, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your “screen name”) that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>EXIF Information<\/p>\n<p>By default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &amp.\nmodel of the camera you used to take the shot.\nYou can elect to hide this link in “Settings” under the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo’s EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis setting can be changed through your account “Privacy and Permissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Location Information<\/p>\n<p>When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application’s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis default display setting can be changed in the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” Settings in your account.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Geofences<\/p>\n<p>A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings.\nThese are useful for locations such as “home” or “school” that you would like to make more private than your global default.\nClick here to create your geofences and manage your geo preferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default.\nFurther, you can change the geo preferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.<\/p>\n<p>Auto-Uploadr Feature<\/p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature on mobile, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to Flickr.\nThese photos and videos will be stored as private (non-public) on Flickr until you choose to share them.\nYou can turn off auto-upload at any time in your mobile app settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above for options for controlling cookies and similar technology.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional Communications<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Flickr by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.<\/p>\n<p>Email Notifications<\/p>\n<p>Visit the “Emails and Notifications” area in your account Settings to edit your Flickr email notification settings.<\/p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<\/p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<\/p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Every individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<\/p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: Flickr Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<\/p>\n<p>UK: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd., Attn: Flickr Inc., 16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2B 5AH, United Kingdom<br> www.dp-dock.com<br> flickr@gdpr-rep.com<\/p>\n<p>Additional Privacy Details for California Residents<\/p>\n<p>The sections below apply to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<\/p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<\/p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA “sale” of California personal information<\/p>\n<p>Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.\nIn the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.\nHowever, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.\nRegardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<\/p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete certain information we have about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.\nYou can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.\n(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nSimilar exceptions are common in other laws.)<\/p>\n<p>To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.\nAlternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.\nNo other requests are accepted at that number.<\/p>\n<p>Contact Us<\/p>\n<p>We welcome your feedback.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or would like to contact us for any reason,

collect through our Services.\nFor example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.\nWe may receive updated information about you, such as an updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card in connection with our billing for the Services.\nWhen somebody buys a gift for you on our service, we’ll receive your shipping information from the purchaser.\nUsers also can share another person’s email address with us through features that can invite the other person to view the user’s content.<\/p>\n<p>Use of Information<\/p>\n<p>Our use

this Privacy Policy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In response

Photographer Personal Data is governed by our agreement with the user who posted it.\nIf you contact us regarding a request or complaint about Photographer Personal Data, we may forward your communication to the user who posted it.<\/p>\n<p>Social Sharing Features and Third-Party Integrations<\/p>\n<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends, the public, and others, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature, and depending on that entity’s other sharing practices.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, you may give certain third-party apps different levels of permissions to interact with your account to take advantage of things like photo editing tools.\nIf you want to stop using one of these apps and revoke your permission, click the \"Remove Permission\" link under \"Sharing &amp.\nExtending\" on your account page and remove that permission.<\/p>\n<p>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others<\/p>\n<p>We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services.\nThese entities may use cookies, web beacons, mobile device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information.\nThis information may be used by Flickr and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nFor more information about interest-based-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices from each browser that you use to access our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google’s collection or use of your data for ad personalization purposes in any particular browser there or at https://www.google.com/ads/preferences.\nYou also can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google Analytics’ opt-out browser add-on in each browser.\nYour device should also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<\/p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing customer service;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving business activities;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing risks and legal issues.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\nFor example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We process a user’s Photographer Personal Data as the user’s “processor” (under the GDPR and similar laws) or “service provider” (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<\/p>\n<p>Security<\/p>\n<p>Flickr takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nFlickr cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<\/p>\n<p>Data Retention<\/p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.<\/p>\n<p>Data Transfers<\/p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by Flickr or our service providers or affiliates in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient’s participation in the EU- U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nFlickr has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification (which is part of the certification of our parent company, SmugMug, Inc.), please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<\/p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in this Privacy Policy, the JAMS mechanism is available only to individuals whose personal data we receive pursuant to Privacy Shield.<\/p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nFlickr, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<\/p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not Flickr) are responsible for their transfers.<\/p>\n<p>Your Choices<\/p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users’ Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<\/p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos that a Flickr user uploaded to or created in the Services, or any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that the same user added to those images and videos in the Services (Photographer Personal Data), please contact that user directly.\nFlickr processes this data on behalf of the user, and the user has responsibility for handling these requests.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, Flickr is the user’s “processor” of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Flickr is the user’s “service provider” for this data.\n(Flickr still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported as described here.)<\/p>\n<p>Flickr users can follow the instructions below to handle privacy requests or to otherwise manage their Photographer Personal Data.<\/p>\n<p>Deleting Photos<\/p>\n<p>You can delete individual photos that you have on Flickr by selecting the photos that you wish to delete, then clicking the delete button.\nOr you can delete groups of photos using batch operations.<\/p>\n<p>Photo Sharing Features<\/p>\n<p>In the \"Privacy &amp.\nPermissions\" section of your Account Settings, you can determine who can see, download, or interact with your content by default.\nYou can control at a more granular level who can see each individual image or video by editing that item’s viewing privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Account Information<\/p>\n<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your online account or contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nYou may delete your account or terminate your subscription pursuant to Flickr’s Terms of Use, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy and Permissions Settings<\/p>\n<p>In your account “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab under “Settings”, you can control who is able to see different parts of your profile, including email address, IM names, real name, and current city.\nIf you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your “screen name”) that information will be publicly displayed through the Services.\nTherefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.<\/p>\n<p>EXIF Information<\/p>\n<p>By default, Flickr will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make &amp.\nmodel of the camera you used to take the shot.\nYou can elect to hide this link in “Settings” under the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo’s EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis setting can be changed through your account “Privacy and Permissions” tab.<\/p>\n<p>Location Information<\/p>\n<p>When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application’s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nFlickr imports that data and if you choose, Flickr can display that data publicly.\nThis default display setting can be changed in the “Privacy &amp.\nPermissions” Settings in your account.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<\/p>\n<p>Geofences<\/p>\n<p>A geofence is a hotspot on a map that has special default geo privacy settings.\nThese are useful for locations such as “home” or “school” that you would like to make more private than your global default.\nClick here to create your geofences and manage your geo preferences to decide who can see the location of your photos by default.\nFurther, you can change the geo preferences setting on individual photos by clicking on the map to the right of each photo.<\/p>\n<p>Auto-Uploadr Feature<\/p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature on mobile, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to Flickr.\nThese photos and videos will be stored as private (non-public) on Flickr until you choose to share them.\nYou can turn off auto-upload at any time in your mobile app settings.<\/p>\n<p>Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above for options for controlling cookies and similar technology.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional Communications<\/p>\n<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Flickr by following the instructions in those communications or by contacting us through https://help.flickr.com/contact.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.<\/p>\n<p>Email Notifications<\/p>\n<p>Visit the “Emails and Notifications” area in your account Settings to edit your Flickr email notification settings.<\/p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<\/p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<\/p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.<\/p>\n<p>Every individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<\/p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: Flickr Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<\/p>\n<p>UK: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd., Attn: Flickr Inc., 16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2B 5AH, United Kingdom<br> www.dp-dock.com<br> flickr@gdpr-rep.com<\/p>\n<p>Additional Privacy Details for California Residents<\/p>\n<p>The sections below apply to “personal information” about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because Flickr is a “service provider” for such data under the CCPA.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<\/p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual’s interactions with Flickr).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<\/p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<\/p>\n<p>CCPA “sale” of California personal information<\/p>\n<p>Flickr does not “sell” and has not “sold” its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don’t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.<\/p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines “sell” and “sold” in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third- party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Flickr generates part of its revenue by allowing personalized third-party advertisements on our service.\nIn the past, this was done in a manner that is more likely to constitute the same sort of CCPA “sale” described above, involving the same categories of data.\nHowever, to prepare for CCPA taking effect on January 1, 2020, we focused those activities on services administered by Google, and we activated the “restricted data processing” settings designed to make this less likely to be a “sale” under the CCPA.\nRegardless, you can limit this activity as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<\/p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) “sold” personal information in the CCPA sense.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete certain information we have about you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<\/p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to “Photographer Personal Data”, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not Flickr.\nYou can find contact information for many users by going to their Flickr page and clicking on “About” section.\n(Even if this were not the case under the CCPA, Flickr would normally have multiple legal grounds for denying CCPA-based takedown requests for Photographer Personal Data due to multiple exceptions under that law, including those applicable to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\nSimilar exceptions are common in other laws.)<\/p>\n<p>To contact Flickr to exercise CCPA rights with respect to other data, please visit http://help.flickr.com/contact for the fastest response.\nAlternatively, you can make your CCPA request via voicemail at (833) 522-8820.\nNo other requests are accepted at that number.<\/p>\n<p>Contact Us<\/p>\n<p>We welcome your feedback.\nIf you have any comments or concerns about this Privacy Policy or would like to contact us for any reason,

version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>As of May 29, 2018, Flickr is owned and operated by Flickr, Inc.\nThese Terms of Use apply to your access to and use of Flickr.com (the “Site”), the official Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications, and the related Flickr services, such as Flickr

other related merchandise, products and services (\"Products\") through Flickr’s approved third party vendors and retailers (\"Flickr Vendors\").<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\nis owned by SmugMug, Inc.\nIn these Terms of Use, the term “SmugMug” refers to Flickr, Inc., together with SmugMug, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries and their respective employees, agents, affiliates and contractors.\nHowever, these Terms of Use do not apply to SmugMug-branded services offered by the SmugMug family of companies.\nPlease see https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms for terms of use applicable to those services.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY.\nBY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR FLICKR PRO SERVICES, OR CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and SmugMug have against each other are resolved (see Section 15 — Dispute Resolution).\nThese provisions require you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court.\nIf you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your use of the Services (such as your purchase of Products) is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use.\nIf you do not consent to these

modify, revise or otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new

Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area,

you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Trials<\/p>\n<p>When you

that you have violated these Flickr Pro Services Terms or the Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>Each Subscription is personal to the individual Flickr user.\nYou may not transfer or assign your Subscription to another individual, entity or Flickr user unless such transfer or assignment is expressly permitted by the terms of your Subscription Plan.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, Flickr may provide certain users with complimentary Subscriptions.\nAny user accessing the Services by using a free Subscription is bound by the Terms of Use and any applicable terms and conditions of these Flickr Pro Services Terms (including Flickr’s right to terminate or cancel such Subscriptions).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Term and Automatic Renewal<\/p>\n<p>Your Subscription is valid commencing on the date in which Flickr provides you with access to the Services pursuant to its receipt of your valid Payment Information (the “Commencement Date”) and will last for the duration of the Subscription term that you select at

SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS TERMINATED AND/OR CANCELED BY YOU OR FLICKR PRIOR TO THE END OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your

may be interrupted from time to time, with or without notice, for maintenance, upgrades, system updates or in the event of equipment failure or for any other foreseeable or non-foreseeable cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO

request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from Flickr.\nIf you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective at the end of any previously paid

Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr may terminate a Subscription, or any user’s access to and use of the Flickr Pro Services, at any time for any reason at its sole discretion, which such termination will be effective immediately.\nIf you violate the Terms of Use, Flickr at its sole discretion may (i) require you to remedy any violation thereof and/or (ii) take any other actions that Flickr deems appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination,

that can be placed on your computer or mobile device via standard browser techniques that uniquely identifies your browser or device.\nWe may use technologies like cookies, pixels and local storage to deliver, secure, and understand products and services.<\/p>\n<p>What are cookies used for?<\/p>\n<p>Cookies and other technologies allow a site or service to know if your computer or device has visited it before.\nThese technologies can then be used to deliver products and services, help us understand how the site or service is being used, help you navigate between pages efficiently, help remember your preferences, and generally enable and improve your experience in using those services.\nCookies can also help ensure marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.<\/p>\n<p>How long will cookies stay on my device?<\/p>\n<p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a \"persistent\" or \"session\" cookie.\nSession cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing.\nPersistent cookies stay on your computer or mobile device until they expire or are deleted.<\/p>\n<p>First and third party cookies<\/p>\n<p>First-party cookies are cookies that belong to Flickr, third-party cookies are cookies that another party accesses or places on your device through our Service.\nThird-party cookies may be placed on your device by someone providing a service for Flickr, for example to help us understand how our service is being used.\nThird-party cookies may also be placed on your device by our business partners so that they can use them to advertise products and services to you elsewhere on the Internet.\nThese companies’ use of cookies and similar technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Flickr Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Why does Flickr use cookies and similar technologies?<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies, pixels, local storage, and similar technologies to show you relevant content, improve your experience, and help protect Flickr and our users.\nWe may use these technologies to deliver the service, provide you with a service that is easy to use, enable you to move around the Service and use its features, such as accessing secure areas, and storing information so that Flickr can respond faster.\nWe may use these technologies to collect information about how you use the Service, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get error messages from certain pages.\nWe may use these technologies to allow us to remember choices you make (such as your user name, the currency you wish to view purchases in or content you have provided access credentials to) and tailor the Service to provide enhanced features and content for you.\nFlickr or our advertising partners may use these technologies to deliver advertising that is relevant to your interests, for example if you are already a Flickr customer, they could be used to not show you advertisements to join Flickr.\nThese technologies can remember that your device has visited a site or service, and may also be able to track your device's browsing activity on other sites or services other than Flickr which also make use of the services of these third parties.\nThis information may be shared with organizations outside Flickr, such as advertisers and/or advertising networks to deliver the advertising, and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.\nWe may use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products and services.<\/p>\n<p>The

cookies?<\/p>\n<p>Cookies are small strings of characters that can be placed on your computer or mobile device via standard browser techniques that uniquely identifies your browser or device.\nWe may use technologies like cookies, pixels and local storage to deliver, secure, and understand products and services.<\/p>\n<p>What are cookies used for?<\/p>\n<p>Cookies and other technologies allow a site or service to know if your computer or device has visited it before.\nThese technologies can then be used to deliver products and services, help us understand how the site or service is being used, help you navigate between pages efficiently, help remember your preferences, and generally enable and improve your experience in using those services.\nCookies can also help ensure marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.<\/p>\n<p>How long will cookies stay on my device?<\/p>\n<p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a \"persistent\" or \"session\" cookie.\nSession cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing.\nPersistent cookies stay on your computer or mobile device until they expire or are deleted.<\/p>\n<p>First and third party cookies<\/p>\n<p>First-party cookies are cookies that belong to Flickr, third-party cookies are cookies that another party accesses or places on your device through our Service.\nThird-party cookies may be placed on your device by someone providing a service for Flickr, for example to help us understand how our service is being used.\nThird-party cookies may also be placed on your device by our business partners so that they can use them to advertise products and services to you elsewhere on the Internet.\nThese companies’ use of cookies and similar technologies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Flickr Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Why does Flickr use cookies and similar technologies?<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies, pixels, local storage, and similar technologies to show you relevant content, improve your experience, and help protect Flickr and our users.\nWe may use these technologies to deliver the service, provide you with a service that is easy to use, enable you to move around the Service and use its features, such as accessing secure areas, and storing information so that Flickr can respond faster.\nWe may use these technologies to collect information about how you use the Service, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get error messages from certain pages.\nWe may use these technologies to allow us to remember choices you make (such as your user name, the currency you wish to view purchases in or content you have provided access credentials to) and tailor the Service to provide enhanced features and content for you.\nFlickr or our advertising partners may use these technologies to deliver advertising that is relevant to your interests, for example if you are already a Flickr customer, they could be used to not show you advertisements to join Flickr.\nThese technologies can remember that your device has visited a site or service, and may also be able to track your device's browsing activity on other sites or services other than Flickr which also make use of the services of these third parties.\nThis information may be shared with organizations outside Flickr, such as advertisers and/or advertising networks to deliver the advertising, and to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.\nWe may use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products and services.<\/p>\n<p>The cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Category of Cookies<\/p>\n<p>Why we use

notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new

Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area,

TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable

may be interrupted from time to time, with or without notice, for maintenance, upgrades, system updates or in the event of equipment failure or for any other foreseeable or non-foreseeable cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO

request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from Flickr.\nIf you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective at the end of any previously paid

Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr may terminate a Subscription, or any user’s access to and use of the Flickr Pro Services, at any time for any reason at its sole discretion, which such termination will be effective immediately.\nIf you violate the Terms of Use, Flickr at its sole discretion may (i) require you to remedy any violation thereof and/or (ii) take any other actions that Flickr deems appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination,

2020<\/p>\n<p>We strive to create consistent standards for all of our users.\nThis agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>As of May 29, 2018, Flickr is owned and operated by Flickr, Inc.\nThese Terms of Use apply to your access to and use of Flickr.com (the “Site”), the official Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications, and the related Flickr services, such as Flickr Pro Services (collectively with the Site and the rest of the foregoing, the “Services”).\nFor example, these Terms of Use apply to your use of the Services to purchase photographic prints, videos or other related merchandise, products and services (\"Products\") through Flickr’s approved third party vendors and retailers (\"Flickr Vendors\").<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\nis owned by SmugMug, Inc.\nIn these Terms of Use, the term “SmugMug” refers to Flickr, Inc., together with SmugMug, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries and their respective employees, agents, affiliates and contractors.\nHowever, these Terms of Use do not apply to SmugMug-branded services offered by the SmugMug family of companies.\nPlease see https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms for terms of use applicable to those services.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY.\nBY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR FLICKR PRO SERVICES, OR CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and SmugMug have against each other are resolved (see Section 15 — Dispute Resolution).\nThese provisions require you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court.\nIf you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your use of the Services (such as your purchase of Products) is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use.\nIf you do not consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use any Services.\nIf you access the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you warrant that you are an authorized representative of such company or entity with the right to bind such company or entity to these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>The Services are not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 16.\nIf you are between the ages of 16 and 18, you may use the Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p> SmugMug reserves the right to change, modify, revise or otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new Services following the posting of the revised Terms of Use or other notice will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.\nOtherwise, any changes or modifications will be effective within thirty (30) days of the posting of the revisions on the Site unless you notify SmugMug within such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop using the Services.\nTherefore, you should review these Terms of Use whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area, the preceding sentence is not intended to constitute your “consent” to any processing of your own personal data for purposes of the GDPR or local ePrivacy legislation, and Flickr will seek such consent separately from these Terms of Use where applicable law requires Flickr to have your consent.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>GENERAL

party.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Dispute Resolution<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Applicable Law<\/p>\n<p>Your use of the Services is subject to all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations.\nThese Terms of Use and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Agreement to Arbitrate &amp.\nWaiver of Representative Actions<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH SMUGMUG AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.\nIF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION 15, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES.<\/p>\n<p>You and SmugMug agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Use or relating to the Services, Site or Flickr Materials.\nARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.\nYou and SmugMug agree: (i) to notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises.\n(ii) to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration.\n(iii) that any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California.\nand (iv) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable).\nThe AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org.\nOther than class procedures and remedies described in these Terms of Use, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, you and SmugMug are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for (1) the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents or (2) allegedly criminal conduct under laws of the United States or any state thereof including, but not limited to, criminal laws addressing pornography, exploitation, obscenity, or hate speech.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different SmugMug or Flickr users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same SmugMug or Flickr user to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe arbitrator’s award will be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nYOU AND SMUGMUG AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND SMUGMUG AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).\nANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER SMUGMUG OR FLICKR USERS.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you and SmugMug agree otherwise, in the event that a court decides that any part of this Section 15 is invalid or unenforceable, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and SmugMug must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California.\nThe remainder of the Terms of Use will continue to apply.\nYou and SmugMug agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Feedback<\/p>\n<p>We welcome feedback from our users regarding ideas and suggestions for improvements to the Site, Services and

upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, you may not assign your rights under these Terms of Use without SmugMug’s prior written consent.\nSmugMug will be permitted to assign its rights under these Terms of Use at its sole discretion.<\/p>\n<p>International Users<\/p>\n<p>SmugMug is located in the State of California in the United States of America.\nIf you access the Services from a country other than the United States, you agree that your transactions with SmugMug occur in the United States.\nYou are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Severability<\/p>\n<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect, and, if legally permitted, such offending provision will be replaced with an enforceable provision that as nearly as possible effects the parties’ intent.<\/p>\n<p>Survival<\/p>\n<p>The terms and conditions of these Terms of Use which by their nature are intended to survive termination or expiration of Services (including, but not limited to, Indemnification, Warranty Disclaimer, Dispute Resolution and the Limitation of Liability) will survive any

such user (the “Subscription Plan”).\nIf you wish to purchase a Subscription, we will ask you to provide certain information in order to facilitate such purchase, including your credit card number, billing address and any related payment information as required by Flickr (collectively, “Payment Information”).\nFlickr may use a third party payment processor (e.g., Amazon Payments or PayPal) to facilitate your payment of any Subscription Fees.\nAny Payment Information that you provide will be governed by the terms of our Privacy Policy.\nBy submitting Payment Information via the Services, you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Trials<\/p>\n<p>When you first register for the Flickr Pro Services, Flickr may offer you the ability to use the Flickr Pro Services without charge for a limited trial period (a “Free Trial”).\nThe duration of a Free Trial will be the number of days specified by Flickr at the time of your registration for such Free Trial.\nYou need to provide Flickr (or our applicable third party payment processor) with valid Payment Information and select a Subscription Plan in order to register for a Free Trial.\nAt the conclusion of your Free Trial, you will be charged for the Subscription Fee applicable to your selected Subscription Plan unless you elect to cancel your Flickr Pro Services account prior to the expiration of your Free Trial.\nFlickr may offer you the ability to register for a Subscription directly without the need to participate in a Free Trial.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Subscription Plans<\/p>\n<p>Flickr offers a variety of Subscription Plans designed to reflect the diverse needs of our users, each with its own features, descriptions, functionality and terms with respect to the use of the Services.\nA description of each Subscription Plan that is currently offered by Flickr is available at

termination provisions described below (including any applicable taxes, such as sales tax), and (ii) you agree that you are only entitled to the features and services applicable to the Subscription Plan that you select at the time you purchase a Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>The Flickr Pro Services are intended to be used by Flickr users for the distribution and sharing of photos and/or videos, as permitted under the user’s applicable Subscription Plan.\nFlickr, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit, suspend or terminate your use of the Flickr Pro Services if Flickr determines that you have violated these Flickr Pro Services Terms or the Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>Each Subscription is personal to the individual Flickr user.\nYou may not transfer or assign your Subscription to another individual, entity or Flickr user unless such transfer or assignment is expressly permitted by the terms of your Subscription Plan.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, Flickr may provide certain users with complimentary Subscriptions.\nAny user accessing the Services by using a free Subscription is bound by the Terms of Use and any applicable terms and conditions of these Flickr Pro Services Terms (including Flickr’s right to terminate or cancel such Subscriptions).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Term and Automatic Renewal<\/p>\n<p>Your Subscription is valid commencing on the date in which Flickr provides you with access to the Services pursuant to its receipt of your valid Payment Information (the “Commencement Date”) and will last for the duration of the Subscription term that you select at the time of your registration for the Flickr Pro Services (the “Subscription Term”).<\/p>\n<p>YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION TERM FOR SUCCESSIVE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS TERMINATED AND/OR CANCELED BY YOU OR FLICKR PRIOR TO THE END OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge at the time of Subscription renewal may differ from the Subscription Fees you originally paid for the Flickr Pro Services if: (i) the Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan changes during your applicable Subscription Term, or (ii) if you change your Subscription Plan or Subscription Term during the previous Subscription Term.\nFlickr will notify you of any changes to the Subscription Fee prior to the date on which your Subscription Term will renew.\nYou hereby agree to any such revised Subscription Fees and your sole remedy if you disagree with such changes is to terminate your account and stop using the Flickr Pro Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Interruptions or Discontinuation of Flickr Pro Services.\nChanges to Flickr Pro Services and Terms of Use<\/p>\n<p>Flickr reserves the right at any time, at its sole discretion and without notice, to suspend, modify, discontinue or permanently cancel the Flickr Pro Services or any portions thereof, including the Subscription Plans and any policies, features and terms applicable thereto.\nIf the Flickr Pro Services, or any part thereof, to which you subscribe are permanently discontinued or canceled by Flickr, your Subscription will terminate, and we will have no further liability to you.\nYou acknowledge that the Flickr Pro Services may be interrupted from time to time, with or without notice, for maintenance, upgrades, system updates or in the event of equipment failure or for any other foreseeable or non-foreseeable cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO ACCESS ANY MEDIA OR MATERIALS ON THE SERVICES.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Termination of Services<\/p>\n<p>You may request the termination of your Subscription at any time by canceling your account in the Subscription section of your Account Settings, or by sending a message through https://help.flickr.com/contact providing clear written notice of such request.\nWhen Flickr receives your termination request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from Flickr.\nIf you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective at the end of any previously paid Subscription Term.\nBy way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, if you request the termination of your Subscription and you have two months remaining in your Subscription Term, such termination is effective at the end of the two months remaining in your Subscription Term and you will have access to the Flickr Pro Services for the remaining two months of such Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr may terminate a Subscription, or any user’s access to and use of the Flickr Pro Services, at any time for any reason at its sole discretion, which such termination will be effective immediately.\nIf you violate the Terms of Use, Flickr at its sole discretion may (i) require you to remedy any violation thereof and/or (ii) take any other actions that Flickr deems appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination, cancellation or discontinuation occurs prior to the expiration of the applicable Subscription Term.<\/p>\n<p>You may change your email, credit card information or other Payment Information for your account by using the Account Settings available in your user profile.\nIt is solely your responsibility to keep your account information and Payment Information accurate and up-to-date.\nIf the Payment Information for your account is invalid and cannot be billed for the renewal Subscription Fee at the time such Subscription Fee is payable and due, then Flickr may terminate your Flickr Pro Services account for nonpayment.\nIf Flickr does not have a current, working email address for your user account, then you may not receive important notices from us regarding your account, including notices regarding termination.\nFlickr cannot guarantee that you will receive notice of the termination of your account.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Backup Policy<\/p>\n<p>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR

the reason for such termination.\nIt is your sole responsibility to create and maintain backup copies of any such User Content on a regular basis.\nPlease note that when User Content or other files are deleted (or your account is cancelled), those files will be deleted as soon as reasonable pursuant to Flickr’s data destruction policies and cannot be recovered by SmugMug or any third party vendor following deletion.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Independent Contractors<\/p>\n<p>Use of the Flickr Pro Services does not create a partnership, agency, joint venture or any employee-employer

SALE”)<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Sale form a part of the Terms of Use applicable to your purchase of any photos, videos, or other Products through the Services.\nOther than as specifically provided in

Vendor, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and costs of collection agencies.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for any taxes that you are obligated to pay or that Flickr may collect from you in

2020<\/p>\n<p>We strive to create consistent standards for all of our users.\nThis agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>As of May 29, 2018, Flickr is owned and operated by Flickr, Inc.\nThese Terms of Use apply to your access to and use of Flickr.com (the “Site”), the official Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications, and the related Flickr services, such as Flickr Pro Services (collectively with the Site and the rest of the foregoing, the “Services”).\nFor example, these Terms of Use apply to your use of the Services to purchase photographic prints, videos or other related merchandise, products and services (\"Products\") through Flickr’s approved third party vendors and retailers (\"Flickr Vendors\").<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\nis owned by SmugMug, Inc.\nIn these Terms of Use, the term “SmugMug” refers to Flickr, Inc., together with SmugMug, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries and their respective employees, agents, affiliates and contractors.\nHowever, these Terms of Use do not apply to SmugMug-branded services offered by the SmugMug family of companies.\nPlease see https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms for terms of use applicable to those services.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY.\nBY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR FLICKR PRO SERVICES, OR CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and SmugMug have against each other are resolved (see Section 15 — Dispute Resolution).\nThese provisions require you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court.\nIf you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your use of the Services (such as your purchase of Products) is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use.\nIf you do not consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use any Services.\nIf you access the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you warrant that you are an authorized representative of such company or entity with the right to bind such company or entity to these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>The Services are not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 16.\nIf you are between the ages of 16 and 18, you may use the Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p> SmugMug reserves the right to change, modify, revise or otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new Services following the posting of the revised Terms of Use or other notice will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.\nOtherwise, any changes or modifications will be effective within thirty (30) days of the posting of the revisions on the Site unless you notify SmugMug within such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop using the Services.\nTherefore, you should review these Terms of Use whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area, the preceding sentence is not intended to constitute your “consent” to any processing of your own personal data for purposes of the GDPR or local ePrivacy legislation, and Flickr will seek such consent separately from these Terms of Use where applicable law requires Flickr to have your consent.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>GENERAL

to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration.\n(iii) that any arbitration will occur in Santa Clara County, California.\nand (iv) that arbitration will be conducted

otherwise be available in court.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, you and SmugMug are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for (1) the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents or (2) allegedly criminal conduct under laws of the United States or any state thereof including, but not limited to, criminal laws addressing pornography, exploitation, obscenity, or hate speech.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different SmugMug or Flickr users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same SmugMug or Flickr user to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe arbitrator’s award will be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nYOU AND SMUGMUG AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND SMUGMUG AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR

AFFECT OTHER SMUGMUG OR FLICKR USERS.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you and SmugMug agree otherwise, in the event that a court decides that any part of this Section 15 is invalid or unenforceable, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and SmugMug must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California.\nThe remainder of the

accordance with these Flickr Pro Services Terms (and the Terms of Use of which they are a part).\nIn the event of any conflict between these Flickr Pro Services Terms and the other provisions of the Terms of Use, these Flickr Pro Services Terms will control.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Subscriptions<\/p>\n<p>The Flickr Pro Services are available to users (i) who register for a free trial (when

such user (the “Subscription Plan”).\nIf you wish to purchase a Subscription, we will ask you to provide certain information in order to facilitate such purchase, including your credit card number, billing address and any related payment information as required by Flickr (collectively, “Payment Information”).\nFlickr may use a third party payment processor (e.g., Amazon Payments or PayPal) to facilitate your payment of any Subscription Fees.\nAny Payment Information that you provide will be governed by the terms of our Privacy Policy.\nBy submitting Payment Information via the Services, you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Trials<\/p>\n<p>When you first register for the Flickr Pro Services, Flickr may offer you the ability to use the Flickr Pro Services without charge for a limited trial period (a “Free Trial”).\nThe duration of a Free Trial will be the number of days specified by Flickr at the time of your registration for such Free Trial.\nYou need to provide Flickr (or our applicable third party payment processor) with valid Payment Information and select a Subscription Plan in order to register for a Free Trial.\nAt the conclusion of your Free Trial, you will be charged for the Subscription Fee applicable to your selected Subscription Plan unless you elect to cancel your Flickr Pro Services account prior to the expiration of your Free Trial.\nFlickr may offer you the ability to register for a Subscription directly without the need to participate in a Free Trial.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Subscription Plans<\/p>\n<p>Flickr offers a variety of Subscription Plans designed to reflect the diverse needs of our users, each with its own features, descriptions, functionality and terms with respect to the use of the Services.\nA description of each Subscription Plan that is currently offered by Flickr is available at flickr.com/pro.\nBy purchasing a Subscription, (i) you agree to pay all applicable Subscription Fees and other charges in accordance with your selected Subscription Plan, pursuant to the renewal and

Plan that you select at the time you purchase a Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>The Flickr Pro Services are intended to be used by Flickr users for the distribution and sharing of photos and/or videos, as permitted under the user’s applicable Subscription Plan.\nFlickr, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit, suspend or terminate your use of the Flickr Pro Services if Flickr determines that you have violated these Flickr Pro Services Terms or the Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>Each Subscription is personal to the individual Flickr user.\nYou may not transfer or assign your Subscription to another individual, entity or Flickr user unless such transfer or assignment is expressly permitted by the terms of your Subscription Plan.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, Flickr may provide certain users with complimentary Subscriptions.\nAny user accessing the Services by using a free Subscription is bound by the Terms of Use and any applicable terms and conditions of these Flickr Pro Services Terms (including Flickr’s right to terminate or cancel such Subscriptions).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Term and Automatic Renewal<\/p>\n<p>Your Subscription is valid commencing on the date in which Flickr provides you with access to the Services pursuant to its receipt of your valid Payment Information (the “Commencement Date”) and will last for the duration of the Subscription term that you select at the time of your registration for the Flickr Pro Services (the “Subscription Term”).<\/p>\n<p>YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION TERM FOR SUCCESSIVE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS TERMINATED AND/OR CANCELED BY YOU OR FLICKR PRIOR TO THE END OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge at the time of Subscription renewal may differ from the Subscription Fees you originally paid for the Flickr Pro Services if: (i) the Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan changes during your applicable Subscription Term, or (ii) if you change your Subscription Plan or Subscription Term during the previous Subscription Term.\nFlickr will notify you of any changes to the Subscription Fee prior to the date on which your Subscription Term will renew.\nYou hereby agree to any such revised Subscription Fees and your sole remedy if you disagree with such changes is to terminate your account and stop using the Flickr Pro Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Interruptions or Discontinuation of Flickr Pro Services.\nChanges to Flickr Pro Services and Terms of Use<\/p>\n<p>Flickr reserves the right at any time, at its sole discretion and without notice, to suspend, modify, discontinue or permanently cancel the Flickr Pro Services or any portions thereof, including the Subscription Plans and any policies, features and terms applicable thereto.\nIf the Flickr Pro Services, or any part thereof, to which you subscribe are permanently discontinued or canceled by Flickr, your Subscription will terminate, and we will have no further liability to you.\nYou acknowledge that the Flickr Pro Services may be interrupted from time to time, with or without notice, for maintenance, upgrades, system updates or in the event of equipment failure or for any other foreseeable or non-foreseeable cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO ACCESS ANY MEDIA OR MATERIALS ON THE SERVICES.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Termination of Services<\/p>\n<p>You may request the termination of your Subscription at any time by canceling your account in the Subscription section of your Account Settings, or by sending a message through https://help.flickr.com/contact providing clear written notice of such request.\nWhen Flickr receives your termination request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from Flickr.\nIf you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective at the end of any previously paid Subscription Term.\nBy way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, if you request the termination of your Subscription and you have two months remaining in your Subscription Term, such termination is effective at the end of the two months remaining in your Subscription Term and you will have access to the Flickr Pro Services for the remaining two months of such Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr may terminate a Subscription, or any user’s access to and use of the Flickr Pro Services, at any time for any reason at its sole discretion, which such termination will be effective immediately.\nIf you violate the Terms of Use, Flickr at its sole discretion may (i) require you to remedy any violation thereof and/or (ii) take any other actions that Flickr deems appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination, cancellation or discontinuation occurs prior to the expiration of the applicable Subscription Term.<\/p>\n<p>You may change your email, credit card information or other Payment Information for your account by using the Account Settings available in your user profile.\nIt is solely your responsibility to keep your account information and Payment Information accurate and up-to-date.\nIf the Payment Information for your account is invalid and cannot be billed for the renewal Subscription Fee at the time such Subscription Fee is payable and due, then Flickr may terminate your Flickr Pro Services account for nonpayment.\nIf Flickr does not have a current, working email address for your user account, then you may not receive important notices from us regarding your account, including notices regarding termination.\nFlickr cannot guarantee that you will receive notice of the termination of your account.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Backup Policy<\/p>\n<p>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR

created.<\/p>\n<p>These Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of Flickr.\nDon't forget that your use of Flickr is subject to these Community Guidelines and our Terms of Service.<\/p>\n<p>Things to do<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Play nice<\/p>\n<p>We're a global community of many types of people, who all have the right to feel comfortable and who may not think what you think, believe what you believe, or see what you see.\nSo, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other members.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Only upload content that you have created.<\/p>\n<p>Respect the copyright of others.\nThis means don't steal photos or videos that other people have shared and pass them off as your own.\n(That's what favorites and galleries are for.)<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Moderate your content.<\/p>\n<p>All content on Flickr, whether public or private, has to be appropriately moderated using our safety and content filters.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Link back to Flickr when you post your Flickr content elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr makes it possible to post content hosted on Flickr to other web sites.\nPages on other web sites that display content hosted on Flickr must provide a link from each photo or video back to its page on Flickr.\nThis provides a way to get more information about the content and the photographer.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Enjoy Flickr!<\/p>\n<p>This is your community.\nCelebrate your creativity, be social and share what's important to you.\nSee the world through others' eyes, participate, find your muse, and expand your horizons!<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Things not to do<\/p>\n<p>Here's the deal: We like to give second chances.\nHowever, when we discover you stepping across any of the lines listed below, we will take action, which may mean deleting your account with or without warning.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Don't upload collections of photos that aren’t yours.<\/p>\n<p>This includes other people's photos, video, and/or stuff you've copied or collected from around the Internet.\nAccounts that consist of such collections may be deleted at any time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't violate copyright laws<\/p>\n<p>If you see photos or videos that you've created in another member's photostream, don't panic.\nThis is probably just a misunderstanding and not malicious.\nA good first step is to contact them via FlickrMail and politely ask them to remove it.\nIf that doesn’t work, you can file a Notice with Flickr's Designated Copyright Agent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't forget to moderate your content<\/p>\n<p>Set the appropriate content filters for your images and videos.\nIn general, anything containing mature content (e.g.\nnudity, gore) needs to be moderated appropriately.\nThis includes your buddy icon and cover photo.\nAlso, sexually explicit videos (e.g.\npornography) are not permitted.\nVideos of artistic nature or educational purpose that contain nudity may be allowed under the moderate safety setting.\nFor additional details check here.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t forget to set the appropriate content type<\/p>\n<p>Set the appropriate content type for your images.\nIn general, anything that is not a photo or video should be classified as a Screenshot or Art/Illustration.\nFor additional

protecting children from criminal predators, particularly in crimes involving child sexual abuse, we will aggressively report and cooperate with law enforcement with the goal of prosecuting to the full extent of the law.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, images, video, comments, faves, and other communications.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't be creepy.<\/p>\n<p>You know the guy.\nDon't be that guy.\nIf you are that guy, your account will be deleted.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't upload content that is illegal or prohibited.<\/p>\n<p>This includes but is not limited to drug use, bestiality, and terrorism.\nIf we find you doing it, your account will be deleted and we'll take appropriate action, which may include reporting you to law enforcement.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t harass other users<\/p>\n<p>Flickr is not a venue for you to harass, abuse, spam, impersonate, or intimidate others.\nSo, be polite and respectful in your interactions with other users.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t violate users’ privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr has a zero tolerance policy towards distributing sexually graphic images of another person without that person’s consent

identity.\nHere are some suggestions for confronting hate online.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t promote or encourage self-harm.<\/p>\n<p>We do not tolerate promotion of self-harm or the encouragement of others to do things that might cause them to get hurt.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't host web graphics<\/p>\n<p>Flickr is not a place to host generic graphic elements of web page designs, logos,

2020<\/p>\n<p>We strive to create consistent standards for all of our users.\nThis agreement was written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.\nIf any portion of this statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>As of May 29, 2018, Flickr is owned and operated by Flickr, Inc.\nThese Terms of Use apply to your access to and use of Flickr.com (the “Site”), the official Flickr mobile and Apple TV applications, and the related Flickr services, such as Flickr Pro Services (collectively with the Site and the rest of the foregoing, the “Services”).\nFor example, these Terms of Use apply to your use of the Services to purchase photographic prints, videos or other related merchandise, products and services (\"Products\") through Flickr’s approved third party vendors and retailers (\"Flickr Vendors\").<\/p>\n<p>Flickr, Inc.\nis owned by SmugMug, Inc.\nIn these Terms of Use, the term “SmugMug” refers to Flickr, Inc., together with SmugMug, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries and their respective employees, agents, affiliates and contractors.\nHowever, these Terms of Use do not apply to SmugMug-branded services offered by the SmugMug family of companies.\nPlease see https://www.smugmug.com/about/terms for terms of use applicable to those services.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY.\nBY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, PURCHASING PRODUCTS OR FLICKR PRO SERVICES, OR CLICKING THAT YOU AGREE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and SmugMug have against each other are resolved (see Section 15 — Dispute Resolution).\nThese provisions require you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court.\nIf you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the Services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your use of the Services (such as your purchase of Products) is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use.\nIf you do not consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use any Services.\nIf you access the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you warrant that you are an authorized representative of such company or entity with the right to bind such company or entity to these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>The Services are not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 16.\nIf you are between the ages of 16 and 18, you may use the Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p> SmugMug reserves the right to change, modify, revise or otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified.\nSuch notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by SmugMug.\nYour use of the Services (such as through your purchase of any Products) or your purchase of new Services following the posting of the revised Terms of Use or other notice will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.\nOtherwise, any changes or modifications will be effective within thirty (30) days of the posting of the revisions on the Site unless you notify SmugMug within such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop using the Services.\nTherefore, you should review these Terms of Use whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>You authorize SmugMug to collect, use, disclose and otherwise process information about you as set forth in our Privacy Policy.\nFor residents of the UK or European Economic Area, the preceding sentence is not intended to constitute your “consent” to any processing of your own personal data for purposes of the GDPR or local ePrivacy legislation, and Flickr will seek such consent separately from these Terms of Use where applicable law requires Flickr to have your consent.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>GENERAL TERMS<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Additional Policies<\/p>\n<p>These Terms of Use and the following additional Flickr terms and policies (as applicable) together constitute a binding agreement between you

responsibility to users of the Services or any other person or entity for performance or nonperformance of such activities.\nSmugMug’s enforcement of the acceptable use provisions set forth in these

appearing on other websites and in search engine results.\nFlickr provides privacy options and settings for your content available in the Privacy &amp.\nPermissions section of your applicable user account (the “Account Settings”).<\/p>\n<p>We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect your User Content consistent with your Account Settings.\nWe cannot, however, guarantee absolute security of your account, your User Content or the Registration Data we collect, and we cannot promise that our security measures will prevent third party “hackers” or other unauthorized parties from illegally accessing the Services or their contents.\nFlickr is not responsible or liable for any third party access to or use of the User Content you post or your Registration Data.\nYou are encouraged to read, understand and use the privacy settings and mechanisms in your Account Settings to manage how your User Content is accessed and used by the public and other users of the

providers.<\/p>\n<p>Your business dealings or interactions with any third parties, including other users of the Services or Flickr Vendors, and any terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such third party.\nFlickr does not endorse, approve, or control any such products, services, advertising or promotions posted to the Services

such user (the “Subscription Plan”).\nIf you wish to purchase a Subscription, we will ask you to provide certain information in order to facilitate such purchase, including your credit card number, billing address and any related payment information as required by Flickr (collectively, “Payment Information”).\nFlickr may use a third party payment processor (e.g., Amazon Payments or PayPal) to

you warrant that you have the legal right to use any such credit card or other payment mechanism that you provide to facilitate the transaction.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Free Trials<\/p>\n<p>When you first register for the Flickr Pro Services, Flickr may offer you the ability to use the Flickr Pro Services without charge for a limited trial period (a “Free Trial”).\nThe duration of a Free Trial will be the number of days specified by Flickr at the time of your registration for such Free Trial.\nYou need to provide Flickr (or our applicable third party payment processor) with valid Payment Information and select a Subscription Plan in order to register for a Free Trial.\nAt the conclusion of your Free Trial, you will be charged for the Subscription Fee applicable to your selected

permitted under the user’s applicable Subscription Plan.\nFlickr, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to limit, suspend or terminate your use of the Flickr Pro Services if Flickr determines that you have violated these Flickr Pro Services Terms or the Terms of Use.<\/p>\n<p>Each Subscription is personal to the individual Flickr user.\nYou may not transfer or assign your Subscription to another individual, entity or Flickr user unless such transfer or assignment is expressly permitted by the terms of your Subscription Plan.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, Flickr may provide certain users with complimentary Subscriptions.\nAny user accessing the Services by using a free Subscription is bound by the Terms of Use and any applicable terms and conditions of these Flickr Pro Services Terms (including Flickr’s right to terminate or cancel such Subscriptions).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Term and Automatic Renewal<\/p>\n<p>Your Subscription is valid commencing on the date in which Flickr provides you with access to the Services pursuant to its receipt of your valid Payment Information (the “Commencement Date”) and will last for the duration of the Subscription term that you select at the time of your registration for the Flickr Pro Services (the “Subscription Term”).<\/p>\n<p>YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION TERM FOR SUCCESSIVE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED UNLESS THE SUBSCRIPTION IS TERMINATED AND/OR CANCELED BY YOU OR FLICKR PRIOR TO THE END OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM.\nSUCH RENEWAL WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY ON THE APPLICABLE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE.\nYOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS IN THE SUBSCRIPTION SECTION.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that upon such renewal, the credit card or other designated payment method in your Account Settings will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan then in effect at the time of renewal.\nIf you disagree with these automatic renewal provisions, your sole remedy is to cancel or terminate your Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge at the time of Subscription renewal may differ from the Subscription Fees you originally paid for the Flickr Pro Services if: (i) the Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan changes during your applicable Subscription Term, or (ii) if you change your Subscription Plan or Subscription Term during the previous Subscription Term.\nFlickr will notify you of any changes to the Subscription Fee prior to the date on which your Subscription Term will renew.\nYou hereby agree to any such revised Subscription Fees and your sole remedy if you disagree with such changes is to terminate your account and stop using the Flickr Pro Services.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Interruptions or Discontinuation of Flickr Pro Services.\nChanges to Flickr Pro Services and Terms of Use<\/p>\n<p>Flickr reserves the right at any time, at its sole discretion and without notice, to suspend, modify, discontinue or permanently cancel the Flickr Pro Services or any portions thereof, including the Subscription Plans and any policies, features and terms applicable thereto.\nIf the Flickr Pro Services, or any part thereof, to which you subscribe are permanently discontinued or canceled by Flickr, your Subscription will terminate, and we will have no further liability to you.\nYou acknowledge that the Flickr Pro Services may be interrupted from time to time, with or without notice, for maintenance, upgrades, system updates or in the event of equipment failure or for any other foreseeable or non-foreseeable cause.<\/p>\n<p>SMUGMUG WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY INTERRUPTION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE FLICKR PRO SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, OR FOR ANY LOSS OR INABILITY TO ACCESS ANY MEDIA OR MATERIALS ON THE SERVICES.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Termination of Services<\/p>\n<p>You may request the termination of your Subscription at any time by canceling your account in the Subscription section of your Account Settings, or by sending a message through https://help.flickr.com/contact providing clear written notice of such request.\nWhen Flickr receives your termination request, Flickr will terminate your Subscription and notify you of such termination via email.\nFlickr may request additional information from you prior to terminating your Subscription.\nYour Subscription is not terminated until you receive confirmation of such termination from Flickr.\nIf you terminate your Subscription, such termination will be effective at the end of any previously paid Subscription Term.\nBy way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, if you request the termination of your Subscription and you have two months remaining in your Subscription Term, such termination is effective at the end of the two months remaining in your Subscription Term and you will have access to the Flickr Pro Services for the remaining two months of such Subscription.<\/p>\n<p>Flickr may terminate a Subscription, or any user’s access to and use of the Flickr Pro Services, at any time for any reason at its sole discretion, which such termination will be effective immediately.\nIf you violate the Terms of Use, Flickr at its sole discretion may (i) require you to remedy any violation thereof and/or (ii) take any other actions that Flickr deems appropriate to enforce its rights and pursue available remedies.<\/p>\n<p>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable.\nUpon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of your Subscription for any reason, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription Fees if such termination, cancellation or discontinuation occurs prior to the expiration of the applicable Subscription Term.<\/p>\n<p>You may change your email, credit card information or other Payment Information for your account by using the Account Settings available in your user profile.\nIt is solely your responsibility to keep your account information and Payment Information accurate and up-to-date.\nIf the

are deleted (or your account is cancelled), those files will be deleted as soon as reasonable pursuant to Flickr’s data destruction policies and cannot be recovered by SmugMug or any third party vendor following deletion.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Independent Contractors<\/p>\n<p>Use of the Flickr Pro Services does not create a partnership, agency, joint venture or any employee-employer

Vendor, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and costs of collection agencies.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for any taxes that you are obligated to pay or that Flickr may collect from you in
