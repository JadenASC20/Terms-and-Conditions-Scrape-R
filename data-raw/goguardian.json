GoGuardian (formally — Liminex, Inc.\ndoing business as GoGuardian — “<strong>GoGuardian<\/strong>”, “<strong>we<\/strong>”, “<strong>us<\/strong>”, “<strong>our<\/strong>”) is an educational technology company that provides K-12 schools and school districts with software facilitating safer access to online educational materials along with technology management.\nThe privacy of each and every user matters deeply to us, and we strive for transparency in all of our data privacy practices—especially when it comes to identifying the information that we collect, use, share, and disclose, as well as how we help keep your information safe.\nWe take our responsibility to protect your information very seriously.\nPlease remember that we are always here to answer any questions you have, and we look forward to working with you for years to come.<\/p>\n<p>This Product Privacy Policy (“<strong>Product Privacy Policy<\/strong>”) explains how we collect, use, share, disclose, and protect information collected from and about our customers, Schools, that are using our GoGuardian Offering(s) and such School’s Authorized School Personnel.\nOur GoGuardian Offerings include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>GoGuardian Admin<\/li>\n<li>GoGuardian Beacon<\/li>\n<li>GoGuardian Director<\/li>\n<li>GoGuardian DNS<\/li>\n<li>GoGuardian Fleet<\/li>\n<li>GoGuardian Teacher<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> This Product Privacy Policy does <em>not<\/em> apply to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>visitors and users of our general audience Website and their information (please see our Privacy Policy for Website visitors (\"Website Privacy Policy\")).\nor<\/li>\n<li>organizations or third parties that GoGuardian does not own or manage, or to individuals that GoGuardian does not employ or manage.\nWe encourage you to review the applicable third party privacy policies and terms of use before submitting any information through those sites or services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>By using our Offerings, you, the school or school district (“<b>School,<\/b>” “<b>you,<\/b>” “<b>your<\/b>”), are declaring that you have read and understand this Product Privacy Policy.<\/strong> If you are acting on behalf of a School, you represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years old and have the authority, the right, and the capacity to legally bind the school and have read and understand this Product Privacy Policy.\nGoGuardian’s Combined Terms of Service and End User License Agreement (\"<strong>EULA<\/strong>\"), and as applicable to the extent your School is in the European Economic Area (\"<strong>EEA<\/strong>\"), our Data Protection Addendum (\"<strong>DPA<\/strong>\"), also apply to how we treat your information.\n<\/p>\n<strong>Information Provided Directly to Us through our GoGuardian Offerings<\/strong>\n<p>The information that we collect depends on the GoGuardian Offerings and features within those GoGuardian Offerings that a School uses.\nWe collect some business information directly from a School (e.g., information collected when signing up to use our GoGuardian Offerings) or from Schools about their students or directly from the School’s students (e.g., browsing information) when we act as their service provider.\nWe also collect some information automatically (e.g., GoGuardian Offerings usage information).<\/p>\n<strong>School and School Official Information<\/strong>\n<p>GoGuardian collects the following information that we collectively label as “<strong>School Information<\/strong>”:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>School Profile Information:<\/em>\n<\/strong> When an official of a School (\"<strong>School Official<\/strong>\") initiates contact through our Website for GoGuardian’s Offerings on behalf of his/her School, we collect that School Official’s contact information as well as information about his/her School relevant to purchasing and setting up our GoGuardian Offerings.\nThis information includes the School Official's name, email address, and phone number, as well as the School’s name, address, billing address, number of devices, number of students, and network configuration.\nIf the School Official creates an account for GoGuardian’s GoGuardian Offerings, the School Official must also create a GoGuardian password.\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Authorized School Personnel:<\/em>\n<\/strong> Following a School Official’s establishment of a School account with GoGuardian, the School Official can use GoGuardian Offerings to add additional School personnel such as other School Officials and teachers (together, \"<strong>Authorized School Personnel<\/strong>\") from their School and designate their appropriate permission levels in GoGuardian Offerings.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Support Requests:<\/em>\n<\/strong> Authorized School Personnel can submit requests about GoGuardian Offerings to our support center (e.g., GoGuardian’s Support Center and GoGuardian’s Help Center) through both our GoGuardian Offerings themselves and from our Website.\nWhen Authorized School Personnel submit support requests through these support centers, we receive these requests and associated contact information.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Additional Information About Authorized School Personnel:<\/em>\n<\/strong> Depending on the GoGuardian Offerings and features selected by a School, GoGuardian Offerings can collect additional information about Authorized School Personnel, including chat messages and video conferencing between students and teachers using GoGuardian Teacher (including if Personnel participate in a chat function as part of a videoconference), GoGuardian-generated unique account identifiers, and other relevant unique identifiers (e.g., Google Classroom identifiers if School integrates Google Classroom with GoGuardian Teacher).\nThis information may change if a School and/or Authorized School Personnel utilize new features and/or GoGuardian Offerings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>Personal Student Information<\/strong>\n<p>In providing our GoGuardian Offerings to Schools, we collect information that may, alone or in combination with other available information, be reasonably used to identify a current or former student enrolled in a K-12 School (“<strong>Personal Student Information<\/strong>”).<\/p>\n<p>GoGuardian only collects Personal Student Information on school-managed devices and/or accounts where a School has already registered with GoGuardian and chosen to use GoGuardian Offerings and where such Schools have provided consent required by applicable law, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).\nEach school in the United States must comply with any legal requirements applicable to it, which may include, providing appropriate notice and/or obtaining parental consent.\nSchools located in countries outside of the United States must also obtain and provide appropriate consent from parents and/or guardians of student or as otherwise required by applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>The Personal Student Information collected by our GoGuardian Offerings on behalf of a School depends on the particular GoGuardian Offerings and features selected by a School and the particular settings enabled or disabled by the School.\nPursuant to such selection, the <strong>Personal Student Information<\/strong> that we collect includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Student’s School-Managed Account Information:<\/em>\n<\/strong> GoGuardian’s Offerings collect a student’s School-managed account information: student’s name, email address, Google Profile ID, Google Image URL, and organizational unit as well as device identifiers necessary to associate a student with a certain device and settings.\nAdditionally, GoGuardian may also need to associate a student with a particular teacher’s classroom by using a Google classroom identifier or other identifier.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Activity Information:<\/em>\n<\/strong> Depending on a School’s currently selected GoGuardian Offerings, features, integrations and settings, GoGuardian may collect additional information, from or about online account or any activity when a user is logged on the school-managed accounts and devices, including chats (within GoGuardian Teacher), video conferencing recordings (including audio and videos of participating Students and chats included in a video conference) (within GoGuardian Teacher), a student’s browsing history, IP address, online content, snapshots, and key percentage variance (but not the actual inputs or sequence of inputs) to identify patterns like gaming) collected when the user is logged on to the school-managed device or account.\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Grade and Attendance Information:<\/em>\n<\/strong> Depending on a School’s currently selected GoGuardian Offerings, features, integrations, and settings, GoGuardian may receive grade and attendance information.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Location Information:<\/em>\n<\/strong> Using GoGuardian Admin, a School can collect the geographic location of devices for the purpose of locating and recovering its devices.\nGoGuardian Offerings can collect IP addresses while GoGuardian Offerings are active, no precise geographic login locations of mobile phones can be accessed or stored by GoGuardian.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Personal Student Information collected may change if a School utilizes new features and GoGuardian Offerings.\n<\/p>\n<strong>Parent/Guardian Information<\/strong>\n<p>If a School chooses to utilize GoGuardian’s guardian feature (such as to enable a School to send important automated notifications to a parent/guardian about his/her child), GoGuardian may receive certain information about a student’s parent(s)/guardian(s).\nSpecifically, GoGuardian may receive a parent’s/guardian’s name, email address, and optionally phone number from the School.\nTo learn whether your child’s School is using this guardian feature or how to update a child’s legal parent/guardian contact information, please contact your child’s School and follow the instructions below in the section below titled <strong>“Requests from Parents, Legal Guardians, Eligible Students, and Authorized School Personnel”.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p> If you are a parent or guardian and you use the Parent App, we collect: 1) your email address to confirm your authorization from the School to use the app and to determine the student associated with you and, once verified, enable the app.\nand 2) automatically collected information about your app activity set forth below.\n<\/p>\n<strong>Information We Automatically Collect through Our Offerings<\/strong>\n<p>Our Offerings automatically collect the following additional information that we label collectively as “<strong>School Log and Cookie Information<\/strong>”:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Analytics Information and Event Information:<\/em>\n<\/strong> Our Offerings automatically collect information through analytics services providers, including IP address, Internet service provider (ISP), date and time stamp, browser language, browser type, amount of time spent on particular portions of our Offerings, and/or other general usage data.\nSimilar to other software, we also collect event information regarding how users interact with our Offerings.\nFor example, we collect information about how much time users spend on certain features of our Offerings.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Log Information: <\/em>\n<\/strong>We also collect log information such as service diagnostics and technical logging information, which may include IP address, login times to our Offerings, usage times of our Offerings, browser type, and browser configuration.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Device Information:<\/em>\n<\/strong> We collect information about the devices that log into our Offerings, including type of device, device settings, and operating system.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Cookies:<\/em>\n<\/strong> We use Cookies in our Offerings for the purposes described in our Cookies Notice.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>How We Use Information Collected Through Our Offerings<\/strong>\n<p>We use <strong>School Information<\/strong> and

Student Information is the property of and under the control of the applicable eligible student, parent, or guardian.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>We do not sell Personal Student Information.\nWe do not use Personal Student Information to target advertisements or market to students or anyone else, to amass a profile about a K-12 educational student for a non-educational purpose, or for any purposes prohibited by the Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act (20 U.S.C.\n§ 1232g.\n34 CFR Part 99.3) (\"FERPA\"), California Business &amp.\nProfessions Code section 22584 (“SOPIPA”), and California Education Code section 49073.1.<\/strong> We will not use Personal Student Information for any purpose other than those required or specifically set forth in this Product Privacy Policy, our EULA, DPA, or any other agreement between a School and GoGuardian.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>We will also use your Personal Student Information in accordance with applicable student privacy laws, including, as applicable, Connecticut's \"Act Concerning Student Privacy\".<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a Product User in the EEA or the United Kingdom (\"UK\"), please see the “Notice to EEA and Other Non-US Residents” section for more information about how we use information and the legal bases for collecting information.<\/p>\n<strong>How We Share Information Collected Through Our Offerings<\/strong>\n<p>We may share or disclose information in the following ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Authorized School Personnel Access:<\/em>\n<\/strong> Each School determines which Authorized School Personnel have access to the School’s account with GoGuardian’s Offerings and their permission levels.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Third Parties Supporting Our Offerings:<\/em>\n<\/strong> We may share information with our service providers that assist us in performing business-related functions that support our Offerings.\nFor example, we use hosting services and customer service tools to help support our Offerings.\nWhen we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>With School Permission or at School Direction:<\/em>\n<\/strong> We may share or disclose information, including Personal Student Information, to third parties pursuant to a School’s instruction or with a School’s permission.\nFor example, if a School chooses to integrate GoGuardian’s Offerings with another third party company’s products or services, then we will share information as instructed.\nWith your permission, we may also share or disclose your name and other content through a testimonial video or quotation.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Protection of GoGuardian and Others:<\/em>\n<\/strong> We may share or disclose certain of the information we collect (set forth above) if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to (i) protect or defend the rights, safety, or property of GoGuardian or third parties, including to defend or enforce our Product Privacy Policy, EULA, or any other contractual arrangement.\nor (ii) to respond to claims that content violates the rights of third parties.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Legal Requirements:<\/em>\n<\/strong> We may share or disclose certain information if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary or appropriate to comply with any law enforcement, legal, or regulatory process, such as to respond to a warrant, subpoena, court order, or other applicable laws and regulations.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Business Transfer:<\/em>\n<\/strong> We may share or disclose certain of the information we collect (set forth above), in connection with or during negotiations of any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.\nIf such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, GoGuardian will comply with such restrictions.\nThe successor entity will be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, including student privacy laws.\nIn connection with such a transaction, we will also work to ensure that the successor entity has a commitment to student privacy.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>De-Identified Information:<\/em>\n<\/strong> We may use, share, or disclose De-Identified information (as that term is defined in our EULA) for various purposes such as product development, research, and marketing, in compliance with relevant laws.\nFor example, we may use aggregate, anonymous data to publish an e-Book on Schools’ most utilized online educational resources.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you are a School or other Authorized School Personnel in the EEA or the UK, please see our Notice to EEA and Other Non-US Residents below.<\/p>\n<strong>How Long We Keep Information<\/strong>\n<p>We retain <strong>Personal Student Information<\/strong> as directed by the School:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>School’s Request for Deletion or Transfer of Personal Student Information: <\/em>\n<\/strong>GoGuardian acts upon a School’s documented instructions to delete Personal Student Information during and after all School licenses to GoGuardian have expired, unless we are required to retain such information to comply with our legal obligations with law enforcement, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\nUpon instruction to delete Personal Student Information, GoGuardian will take reasonable efforts to delete and/or de-identify such information in a commercially reasonable amount of time under applicable laws.\nAt the termination of all of the School’s licenses with GoGuardian, GoGuardian and the School may agree to transfer the School’s Personal Student Information back to the School.\nIn that case, similar to deletion requests, GoGuardian will act upon a School’s documented instruction to transfer the School’s Personal Student Information to the School and take reasonable efforts to transfer such information in a commercially reasonable amount of time under applicable laws, unless we are required to retain such information to comply with our legal obligations, or with law enforcement, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\nFor Schools in the EEA, Personal Student Information will be deleted and transferred/ported according to the terms of the DPA or other agreement between the School and GoGuardian.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Video Conferencing Recordings: <\/em>\n<\/strong> If a School enables the video conferencing feature in GoGuardian Teacher, audio and video recordings will be stored by GoGuardian for ninety (90) days.\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Deactivated Accounts: <\/em>\n<\/strong>We may consider a School’s account to be terminated 365 days after all of a School’s GoGuardian licenses expire without use, reactivation, or renewal by the School.\nAt that time, if a School has not requested deletion of Personal Student Information, we will automatically de-identify and/or delete the School’s Personal Student Information within a commercially reasonable period of time as long as that information is not necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.\nAll Personal Student Information retained will remain subject to our Product Privacy Policy that was in effect at that time — even after the deactivation of an account or termination of a contract.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We generally retain information other than Personal Student Information for as long as it may be relevant to the purposes above or as required or permitted by law.\nTo dispose of any personal information, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate de-identifying steps.\nPlease note that information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional period of time.<\/p>\n<strong>Your Choices about Information Collected through Our GoGuardian Offerings<\/strong>\n<p>You have certain rights and choices with respect to your information as further described in this section.<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about <strong>School Profile Information<\/strong> and <strong>School Log and Cookie

(e.g., by checking the relevant box) or, by following the unsubscribe instructions on communications sent to you.\nYou can also contact us as described in the “How to Contact Us” section below.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Cookies and Analytics.<\/em>\n<\/strong> You can opt out from certain cookie-related and analytics processing by following the instructions in our Cookie Notice below.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>California Rights:<\/em>\n<\/strong> Effective January 1, 2020, under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) , California residents may annually request a list of the third parties to which a company discloses “personal information” (as defined in the CCPA) for such third parties’ marketing purposes and the types of information disclosed.\nHowever, we do not disclose personal information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes.\nThe CCPA offers certain rights for California residents with respect to personal information, but these rights do not apply to business to business information nor to personal information collected by GoGuardian when GoGuardian is acting as a service provider of a School (e.g., business contact, contract and communications information are excluded from CCPA rights.\nYou can read more about any such applicable CCPA rights at our Privacy Policy for Website visitors.\nHowever, even though the CCPA rights may not apply to your data request, if you are acting on behalf of your School and would like to submit a data request, rather than submit a CCPA request, please instead follow the instructions described in the Section titled “<strong>School’s Request for Deletion or Transfer of Personal Student Information.<\/strong>” Similarly, if you are a parent, guardian, eligible student, or Authorized Personnel and would like to submit a data request to GoGuardian, rather than submit a CCPA request, please instead follow the instructions described in the Section titled “<strong>Requests from Parents, Legal Guardians, Eligible Students, and Authorized School Personnel.<\/strong>” <\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Your Legal Rights Under Local Law: <\/em>\n<\/strong>Local laws (e.g., laws of the European Union) may permit an individual to request that we: (1) provide access to and/or a copy of certain information that we hold about that individual.\n(2) prevent the processing of that individual’s information for direct-marketing purposes (including any direct marketing processing based on profiling).\n(3) update an individual’s information which is out of date or incorrect.\n(4) delete certain information that we are holding about an individual.\n(5) restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of the individual’s information.\n(6) transfer an individual’s information to a third party provider of services.\nand/or (7) revoke an individual’s consent for the processing of his/her information.\nIf your local laws provide additional rights, we will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law.\nPlease note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to continue processing an individual’s information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation.\nWe may request that an individual and/or School provide us with information necessary to confirm the individual’s identity before responding to your request.\nTo exercise any of these rights, please contact us as described further in the “How to Contact Us” section below.\nIn addition to those rights, an individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority.\nHowever, we encourage the individual to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve the individual’s concern.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your choices about <strong>School Information<\/strong> (Except <strong>School Profile Information<\/strong>), <strong>Personal Student Information<\/strong>, and <strong>Parent/Guardian Information<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Cooperation with Schools.<\/em>\n<\/strong> We will assist the School in facilitating requests relating to Authorized School Personnel Information and Personal Student Information pursuant to the School’s instruction as explained further in the “How Long We Keep Information Collected Through GoGuardian Offerings\" or in the “Your Legal Rights Under Local Law” sections above.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Requests from Parents, Legal Guardians, Eligible Students, and Authorized School Personnel: <\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Review, Correction, and Deletion Requests.<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li> If a parent, legal guardian, eligible student, or Authorized School Personnel wishes to request a review, correction, deletion of Personal Student Information or School Information, he/she should contact the appropriate School Official of his/her or his/her child’s School.\nGoGuardian will cooperate with the School to fulfill requests pursuant to the School’s verification and instruction within a commercially reasonable amount of time and in compliance with relevant law.\n<\/li>\n<li> Parent App: If you are a user of the Parent App, you can review information about the choices you may have with respect to the personal information you provide through the Parent App in the “Your Choices” section of our Privacy Policy for Website Visitors.\n<\/li>\n<li> If you are Authorized School Personnel, please note that we may be required to maintain certain School Information if directed to do so by your School Official on behalf of your School employer or as needed by GoGuardian to enforce our legal rights.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Transfer Requests.<\/em>\n<\/strong> GoGuardian Offerings allow Authorized School Personnel to download information on behalf of a parent, legal guardian, eligible student, or School Personnel.\nIf GoGuardian Offerings do not cover the scope of the transfer request, GoGuardian will, following documented instructions from the School, honor the requests from the parent, legal guardian, eligible student, or Authorized School Personnel for the transfer of Personal Student Information or personal data of the Authorized School Personnel by utilizing the same guidelines as described above in “Review, Correction, and Deletion Requests” in compliance with and as required by relevant law.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Transfer Requests for Student-Generated Content.\n<\/em>\n<\/strong>California law requires website operators to transfer student-generated content to the student’s personal account when requested by an eligible student, parent, or guardian.\nGoGuardian Offerings are not used as the primary platform for students to submit their own content.\nTo the extent that students in California, or in other states with similar transfer laws, submit their content on GoGuardian Offerings, the appropriate parent, guardian, or eligible student may submit a request to privacy@goguardian.com to transfer this information to him/her.\nFollowing verification of the requestor’s authorization to receive the information (which may require verification by the requestor’s School), we will provide the student-generated content that we have in a commercially reasonable amount of time in either a CSV or other mutually-agreeable format.\nPlease note that we cannot guarantee retention of student-generated content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>How We Protect Your Information<\/strong>\n<p>GoGuardian takes the security and privacy of your School’s data very seriously.\nFor these reasons, GoGuardian has implemented various technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information, including specific training of our personnel authorized to access Personal Student Information and other information.\nThese safeguards vary depending on the sensitivity of the information at issue.<\/p>\n<p>GoGuardian is committed to preventing unauthorized access to our systems and data, and will investigate any possible occurrence.\nIn the event of a breach of Personal Student Information, GoGuardian will comply with all relevant breach laws to assist the School or provide notification as required to you, a School, affected parents, legal guardians, eligible students, and regulators.<\/p> NOTICE TO E.E.A.\nAND OTHER NON-U.S.\nRESIDENTS <p>European Union (“<strong>EU<\/strong>”) data protection laws make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as \"<strong>data controllers<\/strong>\") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as \"<strong>data processors<\/strong>\").\nDepending on the particular circumstance, GoGuardian and your School may act either as a data controller or a data processor of your personal data.\nThe laws in some jurisdictions like the EU also require data controllers to share the legal ground that they rely upon to use or disclose personal information.<\/p>\n<strong>GoGuardian as a Data Controller Vs.\nData Processor<\/strong>\n<p>GoGuardian is considered the “processor” of <strong>School Information<\/strong> (except for <strong>School Profile Information<\/strong>), <strong>Personal Student Information<\/strong> and <strong>Parent/Guardian Information<\/strong>.\nGoGuardian collects, uses, shares and discloses this information as a processor on behalf of and at the instruction of the School controller, pursuant to our EULA and, if applicable, DPA.\nIf you have a question or complaint about how your personal data is handled, please contact your School.<\/p>\n<p>GoGuardian is considered the “controller” of <strong>School Profile Information<\/strong> and <strong>School Log and Cookie Information<\/strong>.\nGoGuardian as the data controller collects, uses, shares, and discloses this information as described above in this Product Privacy Policy.\nWe retain the personal data contained in this information for as long as necessary to provide you with GoGuardian Offerings, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.<\/p>\n<p>Our legal grounds for using <strong>School Profile Information<\/strong> and <strong>School Log and Cookie Information<\/strong> are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Contractual Commitments: <\/em>\n<\/strong>We use, share, and disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to a School.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Legal Compliance: <\/em>\n<\/strong>We need to use, share, and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>With Your Consent: <\/em>\n<\/strong>Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the basis of consent.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Legitimate Interests: <\/em>\n<\/strong>In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, analyzing and improving our business, promotional activities, providing security for our GoGuardian Offerings, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>Information Transfer To The United States<\/strong>\n<p>GoGuardian Offerings are operated in the United States.\nIf you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information that you provide to us will be transferred to and/or accessed within the United States.\nThe recipients of information described in the relevant “How We Share Information” sections above may be located in the United States.\nThis information may be subject to United States law, including laws that may require disclosure of personal information to government authorities.\nSchools may export Personal Data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>European Union-United States and Swiss-United States Privacy Shield: <\/em>\n<\/strong>GoGuardian has certified to the EU-United States and Swiss-United States Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of “personal data” (as defined under the Privacy Shield principles) from applicable European countries.\nWe recognize that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export Personal Data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area.\nGoGuardian will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework.\nFor such data, GoGuardian has certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, purpose limitation, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, recourse, liability, and enforcement for such personal data.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield list by clicking here.\nAs required under the principles, when GoGuardian receives personal data under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on GoGuardian’s behalf, we have certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield.\nand (ii) GoGuardian is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Choices of International Users: <\/em>\n<\/strong>Some international users (including those whose information we collect under the Privacy Shield) of GoGuardian Offerings have certain legal rights to access certain information that we hold about them and to request its deletion.\nPlease see the “Choices about Information Collected through GoGuardian Offerings” section above for more information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>How To Contact Us and Dispute

USING GOGUARDIAN OFFERINGS IN ANY WAY, SCHOOL AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.\nIF THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT IS ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A SCHOOL, SCHOOL DISTRICT, CORPORATION, ORGANIZATION OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, SUCH INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT THEY ARE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OLD AND HAVE THE AUTHORITY, THE RIGHT, AND THE CAPACITY TO LEGALLY BIND SUCH SCHOOL, SCHOOL DISTRICT, CORPORATION, ORGANIZATION OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES TO THIS AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE THE TERM “SCHOOL” SHALL REFER TO EACH SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES.\n<\/p>\n<p>You are free to reject this Agreement, but if you do not agree with all of the provisions of this Agreement, then you may not use our GoGuardian Offerings in any way.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT NOTICES: <\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Section 13.2 contains provisions governing how claims are resolved between us, including a requirement for binding arbitration and class action waiver.<\/li>\n<li>You understand that use of the GoGuardian Offerings may require the consent for monitoring and recording information and communications of all users on the Managed Devices or Accounts under Applicable Law.\nYou represent and warrant that you have obtained such requisite consent.<\/li>\n<li>GoGuardian may make non-material modifications to this Agreement or changes that expand our obligations, reduce your obligations, or introduce a new product offering immediately without notice to you.\nOtherwise, we will only modify or replace this Agreement, after providing notice to you in accordance with Section 14.1.\nYou are responsible for regularly reviewing your GoGuardian Account and our Website for any changes to the Agreement.<\/li>\n<li>Your use of, and participation in, certain GoGuardian Offerings may be subject to additional terms (“Supplemental Terms”) and such Supplemental Terms will either be listed in this Agreement, an Order Form or will be presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up to use the supplemental GoGuardian Offerings.\nIf this Agreement is inconsistent with the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will control with respect to the GoGuardian Offerings with which it applies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>i.\n<i>We have included, in italics at the beginning of each section, summaries that provide short explanations of the legal language in plain English to aid in understanding, but such summaries are not legally binding.<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<strong>1.\nGETTING ACCESS AND GETTING STARTED WITH GOGUARDIAN OFFERINGS <\/strong>\n<p>i.\n<i>This Section explains establishing and maintaining a GoGuardian Account, including orders for GoGuardian Offerings.\nThis Section also reminds you of the importance of being mindful about the information and settings in your GoGuardian Account – the value of our tools is dependent on the accuracy of the information you provide and the proper selection of product settings.<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<p>GoGuardian makes our Offerings available on a paid subscription-based license.\nAs further described in Section 4.1, from time to time and in its sole discretion, GoGuardian may offer limited free, trial or beta GoGuardian Offerings at no additional charge.<\/p>\n<strong>1.1 Ordering<\/strong>\n<p>You may purchase Subscriptions to our Offerings either directly from GoGuardian or indirectly through one of GoGuardian’s Authorized Resellers.\nIf you purchase a Subscription to a GoGuardian Offering through an Authorized Reseller, you will enter into an Order Form directly with such Authorized Reseller and may be subject to additional terms as agreed upon between you and the Authorized Reseller.\nYou expressly agree that this Agreement governs your access to and use of any GoGuardian Offering that you acquire from an Authorized Reseller, as well your relationship with GoGuardian as to any products or services you purchase through an Authorized Reseller, and that GoGuardian has the right to enforce the terms of this Agreement with respect to such purchases.\nYou also acknowledge that no Authorized Reseller is authorized to provide warranties with respect to any GoGuardian Offerings in excess of those provided by GoGuardian in this Agreement.\nThe terms regarding any value-added services provided to you by an Authorized Reseller are solely between you and the Authorized Reseller and we have no responsibility for any such services.<\/p>\n<p>If during the Subscription Term, you would like to expand your base Subscription(s) to include additional licenses above your Licensed Capacity, please contact GoGuardian so that we can send you an additional Order Form for those Add-Ons.\nIf we do not hear from you and you deploy additional Licenses, we or, as applicable, an Authorized Reseller will send you an Order Form and invoice you for the subscriptions to the Add-Ons that you use above your Licensed Capacity.\nAdd-Ons, once deployed and paid, will be rolled into your base Subscription.\n<\/p>\n<strong>1.2 GoGuardian Accounts and School Account Information <\/strong>\n<p>Before accessing certain GoGuardian Offerings, you may be required to create a GoGuardian Account.\nWhen setting up your GoGuardian Account, you may link your GoGuardian Offering with your Google and/or Microsoft Active Directory account for ease of sign on and to pull in a directory of Managed Accounts or Devices.\nIn linking to your Google and/or Microsoft account, you are granting GoGuardian access to certain account information from your Google and/or Microsoft account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of that Google or Microsoft Active Directory account.<\/p>\n<p>1.2.1 <u>Authorized Users

or Accounts, including accurate, up-to-date and complete School Profile Information, Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, and Association Information.\nand (b) promptly update any such information to maintain its accuracy and completeness.\nBecause proper implementation and operation of the GoGuardian Offerings is dependent on the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the Personal Student Information, Parent/GoGuardian Information and Association Information, it is of the utmost importance that your School take great care in maintaining and updating this Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information and Association Information at all times during the Term.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality and security of School Account Information, including protecting, and requiring Authorized Users to protect, usernames and passwords associated with GoGuardian Account, and notifying GoGuardian immediately if you suspect or know that (1) a username and password is known by someone other than the applicable Authorized User.\nand/or (2) your GoGuardian Account (including any individual Authorized User account) has been compromised.<\/p>\n<p>1.2.3 <u>Account Settings <\/u>\n<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for selecting and updating the settings in the GoGuardian Offerings as you see fit and ensuring that the selections comply with all Applicable Law, as well as any guidelines and requirements you have established for monitoring Managed Devices or Accounts and parents’ or guardians’ authorization of such monitoring.\nIf you have questions about any settings in a GoGuardian Offering or GoGuardian Account, such as permissions and settings associated with Managed Devices or Accounts, please visit GoGuardian’s Help Center and/or contact support@goguardian.com.<\/p>\n<strong>1.3 Payment Terms<\/strong>\n<p>Fees due for initial orders, any Add-Ons, and any renewals of GoGuardian Offerings shall be set forth in the applicable Order Form (“<strong>Fees<\/strong>”).\nFees for purchases made directly from GoGuardian shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of GoGuardian’s issuance of an invoice for such purchases, unless otherwise stated on an Order Form.\nPayment obligations for purchases made through an Authorized Reseller shall be as agreed upon by you

taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction.\nyou are responsible for paying all such taxes, levies, duties and assessments associated with purchases and transactions under this Agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Unless otherwise stated on an Order Form, Fees are paid in advance of each billing period.\nPayment obligations under this Agreement are non-cancelable and all Fees paid are non-refundable.\nUpon your cancellation or termination of any Subscription, you remain responsible for payment of all Fees allocable to the terminated portion of the Subscription Term referenced in the applicable Order Form without any refund owed to you, unless otherwise mutually agreed to in writing between you and GoGuardian.<\/p>\n<p>Upon notice to you, GoGuardian may increase any Fees specified in an Order Form, provided the increase will not become effective until the expiration of the current Subscription Term.\nGoGuardian may increase any Fees that are not specified in an Order Form between you and GoGuardian at any time, with or without notice to you.\nGoGuardian may allow you to continue using a free, trial or beta GoGuardian Offering on a paid Subscription basis, but your continued use and your Subscription would be subject to a completed Order Form and payment of the applicable Fee.<\/p>\n<strong>2.\nGOGUARDIAN OFFERINGS<\/strong>\n<p>i.\n<i>This Section explains more about the GoGuardian Offerings to which you have subscribed, including updates and linkage with other third party integration software that GoGuardian makes available to you.\nGoGuardian Offerings may experience downtime or suspend access in certain situations.<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<strong>2.1 Access and Updates to GoGuardian Offerings.<\/strong>\n<p>GoGuardian will make our Offerings to which you have subscribed available to you, subject to the terms of this Agreement.\nFrom time to time, GoGuardian may also make updates to its Offerings to you, including to improve its GoGuardian Offerings.\nYou agree that GoGuardian may automatically install updates, upgrades, and additional features to the GoGuardian Offerings that we deem to be reasonable, beneficial to you, and/or reasonably necessary.\nYou acknowledge and agree that any obligation GoGuardian may have to support previous version(s) of a GoGuardian Offering may end when an update, upgrade, and/or additional feature is made available for the GoGuardian Offering.\nThe license granted for a Subscription shall apply to any updates, upgrades, and/or additional features that are not distributed with a separate license or other agreement.\nIf we make any material changes to a GoGuardian Offering, we will notify you within the GoGuardian Offering interface or by sending you an email.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to a GoGuardian Offering accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an “<b>App Store Sourced Application<\/b>”), you agree to only use the App Store Sourced Application (a) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (b) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.\nIn addition, you acknowledge and agree that the availability of the App Store Sourced Application is dependent on the Apple App Store.<\/p>\n<strong>2.2 Downtime and Suspension of GoGuardian Offerings.<\/strong>\n<p>You acknowledge that you may experience downtime (a) as a result of GoGuardian conducting maintenance.\nor (b) in connection with a force majeure event (as described in Section 14.5).\nIn addition, you acknowledge that GoGuardian, may at its discretion, suspend your access to the GoGuardian Offerings for your breach of this Agreement, if GoGuardian has reasonable grounds to suspect that any School Account Information provided by you or any Authorized User is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if GoGuardian deems it reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate harm to GoGuardian, you, any other of GoGuardian’s customers or a third party if the offerings were not suspended, or to comply, in our sole discretion, with legal requirements.<\/p>\n<strong>2.3 Integrations with GoGuardian Offerings.\n<\/strong>\n<p>GoGuardian may allow you to access certain third party software or offerings through your GoGuardian Account via an application programming interface (“<strong>API<\/strong>”) or other technical connection (such software or offering, an “<strong>Integration Offering<\/strong>”).\nBecause you control whether to integrate and use an Integration Offering, you are solely responsible for all interactions with the Integration Offering, including ensuring appropriate privacy, contractual, and other protections with it as well as ensuring that you are complying with any terms you are required to agree with the provider of such Integration Offering.\nIntegration Offerings are not “GoGuardian Offerings” under this Agreement and are not subject to any of the warranties, service commitments or other obligations with respect to GoGuardian Offerings hereunder.\nThe availability of any Integration Offering through GoGuardian Offerings does not imply GoGuardian’s endorsement of or affiliation with the provider of such Integration Offering.\nGoGuardian does not control Integration Offerings and will have no liability to you in connection with any Integration Offering.\nGoGuardian has no obligation to monitor or maintain access to Integration Offerings, and may disable the ability to integrate with them or restrict access to any Integration Offerings at any time, with or without notice to you (though we, of course, will endeavor to provide notice of any such disabling whenever reasonably practicable under the circumstances).\nBy using or enabling any Integration Offering, you are expressly permitting GoGuardian to disclose School Profile Information, Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, Association Information or other information, including support requests and School Log and Cookie Information to the extent necessary to utilize the Integration Offering.\nYOUR USE OF INTEGRATION OFFERINGS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS SUBJECT TO ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, CONDITIONS AND POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SUCH INTEGRATION OFFERINGS (SUCH AS TERMS OF SERVICE OR PRIVACY POLICIES OF THE PROVIDERS OF SUCH INTEGRATION OFFERINGS).<\/p>\n<strong>3.\nYOUR USE OF GOGUARDIAN OFFERINGS AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

Agreement.\nAny unauthorized use of a GoGuardian Offering terminates School’s right to use all GoGuardian Offerings.<\/p>\n<strong>3.2 School Responsibilities <\/strong>\n<p>School will (a) be

the security, integrity or availability of a GoGuardian Offering may result in immediate suspension of access to any or all GoGuardian Offerings.<\/p>\n<p>School acknowledges that it is solely responsible for compliance with any legal or policy obligations related to the protection of the well-being of its students and that it understands that certain GoGuardian Offerings are only intended to be a tool to assist School as part of a broader program intended to fulfill any legal or policy applications, to the extent applicable.\nThe GoGuardian Parties make no representation or warranty

TERMS FOR FREE, TRIAL AND BETA OFFERINGS<\/strong>\n<p>i.\n<i>This Section explains that we may make free, trial, or beta offerings available for you to test and provide GoGuardian with Feedback about

students, as permitted by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) for using GoGuardian Offerings in connection with students under thirteen (13) years of age, if any, through a COPPA Notice and Disclosure Form provided to School.\nFor transparency and informational purposes, GoGuardian also distributes this COPPA Notice and Disclosure Form to Schools with children of all ages, including ones who do not have students under thirteen (13) years of age.\nTo the extent School is located in the European Union (“<strong>EU<\/strong>”), European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA<\/strong>”), or Switzerland, GoGuardian’s Data Processing Addendum also applies to your use of the GoGuardian Offerings.\nSchool hereby authorizes GoGuardian to use School Information in

notifications .\nIt is important for you to understand these features and settings, and to review alerts and notifications carefully and promptly so that you can properly intervene to help students stay safe.<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<p>Some GoGuardian Offerings contain features that generate alerts and/or notifications for School or a designated Authorized User’s review and attention related to a user’s activity through a Managed Device or Account.\nThese alerts and notifications are tools designed to help you support and protect the wellbeing of your students and school community.\nIf you receive an alert and/or gain access to any information that triggers a legal obligation, such as a reporting or intervention duty for you (including, for an example, an alert from a GoGuardian Offering that one of your students is potentially at risk of suicide), it is your sole responsibility to fulfill that legal obligation and take any additional, responsible actions necessary to safeguard the students in compliance with Applicable Law.\nIn addition, to the extent you elect not to receive one or more types of alerts and/or notifications in your settings, you are solely responsible for that decision.\nGoGuardian does not review alerts generated through any of the GoGuardian Offerings or take any action based on these alerts.\nor review your settings.<\/p>\n<p>Your escalation and notification list for such alert and/or notification feature in your account for a particular GoGuardian Offering may change from time to time, including because contact information changes (e.g., changes in School Profile Information, Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information and Parent/Guardian Information (e.g., contact information, including an Authorized User’s email address, or changes in Parent/Guardian Information ), and Association Information, including, for example, the relationship of an Authorized Personnel User or a guardian/parent to a child/student changes (e.g., change in guardianship or educational rights holder).\nWithout limiting the generality of Section 1.1.2, it is important that you maintain accurate and up-to-date Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, and Association Information to ensure the appropriateness and timeliness of any alerts and notifications generated through a GoGuardian Offering.\nIt is also important that you remind parents/guardians to update School of any changes, including contact information and guardianship.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, without limiting the generality of the other terms of this Agreement, if your School uses GoGuardian Beacon, your School represents and warrants that your School: (1) is solely responsible for having, to the extent legally required, an up-to-date and easily available suicide prevention policy.\n(2) is solely responsible for having, to the extent legally required, a necessary suicide prevention program.\nand (3) your School will notify parents/guardians about your School’s adoption of GoGuardian Beacon and educate them about suicide prevention (including, suicide risk factors, warning signs, and resources) before enabling the Guardian Notification feature (or similar functionality) of GoGuardian Beacon.<\/p>\n<strong>10.\nWARRANTIES,

Action Waiver (“Arbitration Agreement”)<\/strong>\n<p> In the event of a dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any GoGuardian Offering, any person’s access to and/or use of a GoGuardian Offering, and/or the provision of content, features, and/or technology on or through a GoGuardian Offering (collectively, “<strong>Claims<\/strong>”), the parties must first give the other notice of the Claim.\nThis notice must include a brief written statement with the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, as well as the facts giving rise to the Claim and the relief requested.\nYou must send any such notice to GoGuardian by email to terms@goguardian.com AND by U.S.\nMail to GoGuardian, 2030 E Maple Ave, El Segundo, CA 90245.\nIf we have your

and good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days from the date that any notice of a Claim is sent.\nAfter thirty (30) days, you or GoGuardian may resort to the other alternatives described in this Section 13.2.1.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the notice requirement in this section and the 30-day negotiation period required shall not apply to Claims involving patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, trade secrets or piracy or unauthorized use of a GoGuardian Offering.<\/p>\n<p>13.2.1 <u>Binding Arbitration<\/u>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<i>Arbitration Rules and Forum<\/i> Except as otherwise specifically set forth below, any Claims between you and GoGuardian, if unresolved through informal consultation and negotiation pursuant to the preceding paragraph, shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in Los Angeles, California.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if School is a United States public and accredited educational institution domiciled in a state within the United States that expressly requires a different location for arbitration other than Los Angeles, California, then School’s state’s required location for binding arbitration will apply.\nIf School is a United States public and accredited educational institution and School’s consent to binding arbitration is expressly prohibited by the laws of the state within the United States in which School’s educational institution is domiciled, then this Section is hereby waived.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures (collectively, “<strong>JAMS Rules<\/strong>”), as modified by this Agreement, and administered by JAMS.\nThe JAMS Rules and fee information are available at www.jamsadr.org or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267.\nThe arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and GoGuardian.\nThe arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.<\/p>\n<p>\n<i>Exceptions: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims<\/i> Claims concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and Claims of piracy or unauthorized use of any GoGuardian Offering shall not be subject to arbitration under this Section 13.2.1.\nIn addition, you or GoGuardian may choose to pursue a Claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and GoGuardian otherwise qualify for such small claims court and where the Claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.<\/p>\n<p>\n<i>Authority of Arbitrator<\/i> In binding arbitration, the arbitrator shall have the authority (a) to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Claim.\n(b) to award monetary damages.\nand (c) to grant any non-monetary remedy or reli ef available to an individual under Applicable Law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.<\/p>\n<p>\n<i>Confidentiality<\/i> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential.\nBoth parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.\nThis paragraph shall not prevent you or GoGuardian from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.<\/p>\n<p>13.2.2 <u>Class Action Waiver<\/u>\n<\/p>\n<p>YOU AND GOGUARDIAN HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.\nYou and GoGuardian are instead electing that all Claims not otherwise resolved informally as permitted above shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.\nAn arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.\nHowever, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.<\/p>\n<strong>14.\nACCESSING AND DOWNLOADING AN APP STORE SOURCED APPLICATION<\/strong>\n<p>i.\n<i>This Section explains terms related to accessing and downloading an App Store Sourced
