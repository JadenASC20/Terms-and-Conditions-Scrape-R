Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) Vonage is responsible for the event giving rise to the

PASSWORD.\nCHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE IN&nbsp;THE ACCOUNT DASHBOARD.\nIF CUSTOMER FAILS TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, CUSTOMER AGREES THAT VONAGE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING

responsible for all costs of collection.\nIf Customer disputes any invoiced charges exceeding EUR 1,000 in a detailed writing provided to Vonage, and such disputes are reasonable and made in good faith (as reasonably determined by Vonage), then (i) the Parties shall discuss and attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith in a timely manner, and (ii) Customer may withhold the disputed portion of the invoice exceeding EUR 1,000 if Customer has paid the undisputed portion of the invoice in accordance with the Agreement, until the dispute is resolved.\nCustomer’s credit shall be limited to

to and use of the Services and shall not deduct any such amounts, or any other withholdings, set-offs or deductions, from amounts Customer owes Vonage, but will not be responsible for taxes based on Vonage’s net income.\nCustomer may present Vonage with an exemption certificate eliminating Customer’s and Vonage’s liability to pay certain Taxes.\nOnce Vonage has received and approved the exemption certificate, Customer shall be exempt from those Taxes on a going-forward basis.\nIf, a taxing jurisdiction determines that Customer is not exempt from Taxes and assesses those taxes, Customer shall

exempt Customer from timely paying any undisputed amounts owed.\nAny disputes that cannot be resolved in accordance with the foregoing shall be handled in accordance with Section 13 below.\nOther than in accordance with the foregoing, fees paid are non-refundable.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.&nbsp;License<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>Subject to Customer’s compliance with this

has a dispute or claim against the other Party (except with respect to billing disputes), the disputing Party shall provide written notice to the other Party.\nThe Parties agree to escalate disputes to their respective management, who will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute by consulting with each other in good faith to reach an equitable resolution satisfactory to both Parties within 30 calendar days of the receipt of notice.\nNeither Party shall pursue or commence proceedings regarding the dispute in any court, administrative arbitral or other adjudicative body prior to engaging in such consultations and negotiations.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>b.&nbsp;<u>Binding Arbitration.<\/u>&nbsp;If negotiations fail to resolve the dispute within 30 calendar days, and/or small claims court is not a valid option due to the size or nature of the claim, all disputed claims (except for claims relating to intellectual property rights, indemnity, or confidentiality obligations, fraudulent or unauthorized use, theft, or piracy of service, or matters relating to injunctions or other equitable relief) must be resolved by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator, in the English language.\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be given the broadest possible meaning under applicable law.\nThe initiation of an arbitration dispute shall not otherwise prevent Vonage or Customer from terminating Services in accordance with the Agreement.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>c.&nbsp;<u>Location and Procedure.<\/u>&nbsp;A Party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other Party a written notice of dispute, which must describe the nature and basis of the dispute and set forth the specific relief sought.\nThe location of

Act and not by any state or national law concerning arbitration.\nThe amount of any settlement offer made by Customer or Vonage shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which Customer or Vonage is entitled.\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.\nAny provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this Agreement.\nThe prevailing Party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>d.&nbsp;<u>Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver.<\/u>&nbsp;Each Party waives its right to a trial by jury for claims subject to arbitration hereunder.\nThe arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual Party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that Party's individual claim.\nThe arbitrator may not award special, indirect, punitive, incidental or consequential damages.\nCUSTOMER MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST VONAGE ONLY IN CUSTOMER’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND CUSTOMER EXPRESSLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION SUIT.\nThe arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's or entity's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>e.&nbsp;<u>Equitable Relief.<\/u>&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall be entitled to enforce its intellectual property rights and seek equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.&nbsp;Miscellaneous.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>a.&nbsp;<u>Entire Agreement.\nHeadings.<\/u>&nbsp;This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Customer and Vonage with respect to the Site and Services, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between Customer and Vonage with respect thereto.\nThe section and paragraph headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect their interpretation.\nNo oral or written information or advice given by Vonage or its employees and other representatives will create any obligations or warranty on behalf of Vonage unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by an authorized Vonage representative.\nAny purchase orders, confirmations, payment documentation, or other terms provided by Customer, even if signed by the Parties after the date hereof, shall have no force or effect.\nIn the event that the Parties have executed versions of this Agreement drafted in more than one language, the English language version shall govern and prevail.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>b.&nbsp;<u>Modifications/Waivers.<\/u>&nbsp;Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, this Agreement may not be changed or modified, nor may any provisions hereof be waived, nor may any consent or confirmation be considered to have been given, except by an agreement in writing signed by the Party against whom enforcement of the change or modification is asserted, and any such modification, change, waiver, consent or confirmation on Vonage’s behalf may only be given by an authorized signatory of Vonage.\nThe failure of either Party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>c.&nbsp;<u>Severability.<\/u>&nbsp;If any provision of this Agreement, or any part of such provision, is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be (to the minimum extent necessary) replaced by a valid and enforceable provision the effect of which comes as close as possible to the intended economic effect of the unenforceable or invalid provision, so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>d.&nbsp;<u>Force Majeure.<\/u>&nbsp;Neither Party is liable for any failure of performance (other than for delay or performance in the payment of money due and payable hereunder) to the extent such failure is due to any cause or causes beyond such Party’s reasonable control, including acts of God, fire, explosion, vandalism, cable cut, adverse weather conditions, governmental action, acts of terrorism, strikes and similar labor difficulties, war, sabotage, outages of third party connections, utilities, or telecommunications networks, including, without limitation, carrier-related problems or issues, internet-access issues, denial of service attacks, shortage or unavailability of supplies, and other mechanical, electronic or communications failures or degradation.\nEither Party’s invocation of this clause will not relieve Customer of its obligation to pay for any Services actually provided or permit Customer to terminate any Services except as expressly provided herein.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>e.&nbsp;<u>Notices.<\/u>&nbsp;Customer hereby authorizes Vonage to send notices to Customer relating to this Agreement (e.g., Service updates, notices of breach and/or suspension) via email to the email address Customer provides to Vonage in Customer’s Account, in addition to the other means and methods set forth in this Agreement.\nIt is Customer’s responsibility to keep Customer’s email address current, and Customer will be deemed to have received

Vonage.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>d.&nbsp;Notwithstanding Section 3(d), Customer will have a reasonable period from the date of any charge to dispute such charge.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>e.&nbsp;As to non-German Customers who reside in the EU, notwithstanding Section 11, the following shall apply in relation to the limitation of liability:<\/p>\n<p>i.&nbsp;The Parties shall only be fully liable for intent and gross negligence as well as damages caused by injury to life, body or health;<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>ii.&nbsp;In an event of slight negligence, the Parties shall be liable only for breaches of a material contractual obligation (cardinal duty).\nA “cardinal duty” in the sense of this provision is an obligation whose fulfillment makes the processing of this Agreement possible in the first place and on the fulfillment of which the other Party may therefore generally rely;<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>iii.&nbsp;In any of the above mentioned cases, the Parties shall not be liable for any lack of commercial success, lost profits and indirect damages;<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>iv.&nbsp;Liability in accordance with the above clauses shall be limited to the typical, foreseeable damages: and<\/p>\n<p>v.&nbsp;Except where otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Parties shall not be liable for any loss or damage or any costs, expenses or other claims including without limitation loss of profit, business, revenue, goodwill or anticipated savings, loss of any data or information and/or special or indirect loss or consequential loss or otherwise which arise out of or in connection with this Agreement.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>f.&nbsp;As to German Customers, notwithstanding Section 11, the following shall apply in relation to the limitation of liability:<\/p>\n<p>i.&nbsp;The liability of Vonage is unlimited for damages arising out of death, injury to body or health based on a breach conducted by a legal representative or designated agent of Vonage, as well as for damages that arise from the lack of a guaranteed characteristic or in case of fraudulent intent;<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>ii.&nbsp;The liability of Vonage is unlimited for damages caused by Vonage, a legal representative, or designated agent by intent or gross negligence;<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>iii.&nbsp;In case of a slight negligent breach of a contractual core duty Vonage shall, except in the cases pursuant to (i) and (iv), only be liable to the amount of the typically foreseeable damage.\nContractual core duties abstractly are such duties whose accomplishment enables proper fulfilment of the contract in the first place and whose accomplishment a contractual party regularly may rely on;<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>iv.&nbsp;Liability pursuant to the German Product Liability Act remains unaffected;<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>v.&nbsp;The limitation period for claims for damages shall be one (1) year, except in the case of (i), (ii) and (iv) above, where the statutory statute of limitations shall apply.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>vi.&nbsp;Insofar as telecommunication services are affected, Vonage shall, except in cases pursuant (i) and (iv) above, in cases of slight negligent breach of a contract only be liable for an amount that does not exceed EUR 12,500 vis-à-vis Customer and vis-à-vis all damaged parties an amount that does not exceed EUR 10,000,000 per damaging event.\nIf, in the latter case, the compensation exceeds the said maximum amount payable to several parties due to the same event, the compensation shall be reduced in proportion to the ratio between the total claims for damages and the upper limit.<\/p>","created_at":"2020-10-20 15:31:24.141863","updated_at":"2020-10-20
