agreement will be effective for all users as of October 31, 2020.<\/p> Welcome to PayPal! <p>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal Pte.\nLtd., a Singaporean company governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nIf you are an individual, you must be a resident of one of the countries/regions listed on the <strong>PayPal Worldwide<\/strong> page and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your country/region of residence to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of one of the countries/regions listed on the <strong>PayPal Worldwide<\/strong> page to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nYou also agree to comply with the following additional policies and each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>Alternative Payment Methods Terms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, the terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may amend this user agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it on our website, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you with at least 14 days notice.\nAll future changes set out in the Policy Updates page already published on the Legal Agreements page at the time you register for the PayPal services are incorporated by reference into this user agreement and will take effect as specified in the Policy Update.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not agree to the revised terms and conditions, you must stop using the PayPal services, close your account and terminate your relationship with us without cost or penalty.\nThis user agreement will continue to apply to your previous use of our services.<\/p> About our main business <p>PayPal is a payment services provider and acts as such by creating, hosting, maintaining and providing our PayPal services to you via the internet.\nOur services allow you to send payments to anyone with a PayPal account, and, where available, to receive payments.\nOur service availability varies by country/region.\nYou can see what services are available in your country/region by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>The PayPal services are offered by PayPal Pte.\nLtd.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consumer Advisory — PayPal Pte.\nLtd., the holder of the PayPal stored value facility, does not require the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\nConsumers (users) are advised to read the terms and conditions carefully.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement is not a solicitation of the PayPal services and PayPal is not targeting any country/region or market through this user agreement.<\/p> Opening an Account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.<\/p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive payments.<\/li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.<\/li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods.<\/li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods from others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>In order to open and maintain a PayPal account, you must list your correct country/region of residence and provide us with correct and updated account information, including but not limited to personal information, financial information, or other information related to you or your business.<\/p>\n<p>You must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p> Personal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send payments to family and friends, a personal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal account you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy goods and services.<\/li>\n<li>Send and request payments from friends and family.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>You can also use a personal account to receive payments for the sale of goods and services, but if you plan to use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should consider a business account.\nYou can convert your PayPal account from a personal account to a business account should circumstances change.<\/p> Business accounts <p>We recommend business accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business account, you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening, when you request certain new products and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business account.<\/strong>\n<\/p> Commercial Entity Agreement <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.<\/p> Third Party permissions <p>You must be the beneficial owner of your PayPal account, and conduct business only on behalf of yourself.<\/p>\n<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.\nIn some cases, you can do this when logged into your PayPal account – in other cases, you can do this directly with the third party.\nYou acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your PayPal account to this third party.<\/p>\n<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;<\/li>\n<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your PayPal account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.\nYou are liable to us for the actions that you authorize the third parties to carry out.\nYou will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost or penalty, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nYou must withdraw or transfer any PayPal balance from your PayPal account before closing it.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.\n<\/p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card or a bank account to your PayPal account as a payment method.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (i.e.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.<\/p> Holding a PayPal Balance <p>Any PayPal balance you hold represents an unsecured claim against PayPal.\nPayPal combines your balance with the balances of other users and invests those funds in liquid investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held separate from PayPal's corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.\nYou will not receive interest or other earnings on the amounts in your balance.\nYou agree PayPal shall own the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nYou agree to assign any rights to any interest derived from your funds to PayPal.<\/p> Adding or Withdrawing Funds Adding funds to your balance <p>You may use the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to fund transactions you make using your PayPal account.\nYou don't need a PayPal balance to buy something or send payments.\nYou can add funds your PayPal account from the bank account that's linked to your PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer to your PayPal account.\nThe amount transferred will be held as a balance in your PayPal account.\nCredit cards cannot be used to add funds to your PayPal balance.<\/p> Withdrawing funds from your balance <p>If you have a PayPal balance, log into your PayPal account to see which of these withdrawal options are available in your country/region:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it to a bank account linked to your PayPal account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>transferring it to your debit or credit card, where available.\nor<\/li>\n<li>requesting a physical cheque through the mail, where available.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on the country/region in which your account is registered, you may be able to withdraw your funds through a third party service provider.\nPlease see terms of such third party for information regarding currency conversions.<\/p>\n<p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or the negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit card or debit card information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may charge a fee to make a transfer to your bank account.\nIf your debit card is eligible to receive withdrawals from your PayPal account, you will be provided the option to use it when you transfer funds out of your PayPal balance, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for personal accounts) page and the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business accounts) page.\nThe applicable fees will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, we will send physical cheques through the mail only to confirmed addresses, unless we have verified your PayPal account.\nWe will not send cheques to post office boxes.\nIf you would like us to send a cheque to an address that does not meet these criteria, you must contact customer service and provide the documentation that we request to verify your association with the address.\nIf you fail to cash a cheque within 180 Days of the date of issuance, we will return the funds to your balance (minus a fee).<\/p> Managing Your Balance in Multiple Currencies Holding multiple currencies <p>Your PayPal balance may be held in any of the currencies supported by PayPal, and you may hold a balance in more than one of these currencies at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your PayPal account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the balance into another currency.\nIf you convert the balance in your account, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of your balance that you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.<\/li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the balance in the opening currency of your account or such other currency that PayPal supports for withdrawal in your registered country/region.\nIn order to withdraw the balance in your account which is held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate, including our currency conversion fee, will be used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To receive funds in a currency that your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your PayPal account in that currency or convert the balance into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in your PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.<\/p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).<\/p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe currency conversion fee applicable can be found on our fees page under the heading Currency conversion fees.<\/p>Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and involves a currency conversion by PayPal, you consent to and authorize us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis currency preference selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and the fees they may charge.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use your existing PayPal balance or your linked bank account is the payment method.<\/p> Account Statements Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSending payments and buying Sending payments to or Receiving payments from a Friend or Family Member Sending payments <p>In some countries/regions, you can send funds to a friend or family member from your PayPal account using the send payments feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called personal payments or peer-to-peer/P2P payments).\n<\/p>\n<p>Visit our Available Services by Country/Region of Residence list to see which services are available in your country/region of residence or log into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>You can send funds to a friend or family member even if they don't have a PayPal account at the time you send them funds, using their email address or mobile number, in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending funds does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't claim it, it will be refunded to you.\nReceiving funds from a friend or family member is described under <strong>Receiving Funds<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of funds you can send, including funds you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging in to your PayPal account.\nWe may increase your sending limits if you complete the same steps to verify your information as is required for the removal of withdrawal limits.<\/p>\n<p>When you send funds to a friend or family member, one of three things may happen: they may accept, decline or fail to claim the funds.\nIf they either decline to accept the funds or don't claim them within 30 days of the date they are sent, the funds (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal Credit as the payment method, or<\/li>\n<li>Your PayPal balance, if you used your PayPal balance as the payment method or a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Receiving payments <p>If a friend or family member sends funds to you, the funds will appear in your PayPal balance.\nTo receive funds in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the funds into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p> Fees for Sending payments to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending funds can be found in our Sending funds table and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send funds to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert your PayPal balance from one currency to another, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you send funds to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party's product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.<\/p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal in any currency that the seller accepts, and that PayPal supports, using the funds in your PayPal balance, or using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer's website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Sending a payment to a seller for good or services.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller's physical store.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.<\/p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third-party websites or applications, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>American Express may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as branded airlines and certain travel merchants;<\/li>\n<li>Some credit cards may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as those in the gambling industry.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Credit cards cannot be used to send personal payments or to top up your PayPal balance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied as described in the How we convert currency section and will be determined at the time the payment is processed.<\/p>\nFees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you don't pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>Your credit card or debit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for transactions.<\/p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don't clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\nAutomatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows the seller to take funds from your PayPal account with your authorization on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>You may cancel an automatic payment up to 3 Business Days before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the PayPal Help Centre.\nOnce an automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller funds for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for and you may be required to pay the seller through alternative means.<\/p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs a currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal's currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal balance.\nIf you used a bank account as the payment method for the transaction, we will refund the payment to your bank account, or to your PayPal balance if we cannot refund it to your bank account.\nFor purchases you make in a seller's store location that you paid for using your PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will be refunded to your PayPal balance.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal performed a currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>within 1 day of the date of the original payment, the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) used at the time of the original payment will apply.<\/li>\n<li>beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) on the date of the refund will apply.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\nThis means that you may not receive the full amount of your original payment due to the fees above and fluctuations in currency conversion rates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Payments will be refunded in the currency you paid, or if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.<\/p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction Selecting a preferred payment method <p>In certain countries, you can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.<\/p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions and automatic payments with a seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the \"Manage\" link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.<\/p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.<\/p> Sending payments to friends and family <p>When you send payments to friends and family using your PayPal balance (if available) or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the \"Change\" link on the Send Payments page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send the payment.<\/p>\nAutomatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way to pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can select a payment method for future purchases with a particular seller either at the time of creating the agreement or in your account settings.\nFor example, you can instruct your monthly movie subscription service to always charge your credit card for the monthly cost.<\/p>\n<p>If your chosen payment method is unavailable (e.g.\ncredit card expired), a particular agreement with a seller does not provide for the ability to specify a payment method, or if you have not designated a payment method for future transactions with a seller, the payment method used will be in the following order, as applicable: 1.\nbalance.\n2.\nbank account (instant transfer).\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\ndebit card.\n6.\ncredit card.\nand 7.\neCheque.<\/p>\n<p>You can cancel any agreement in your account settings.<\/p>\nBank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.<\/p> eCheque <p>eCheque is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside of your country/region.<\/p>\n<p>If eCheque is your preferred payment method, it will be used to fund your PayPal payment, even if you have a balance.<\/p> PayPal’s Buyer Protection Program PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal's Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Buyer Protection program.\nPayPal's original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal's Buyer Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal's Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an \"Item Not Received\" claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a \"Significantly Not as Described\" claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Buyer Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions.<\/p>\nItem Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>will not<\/em> qualify for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program for an Item Not Received claim if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller's store location, or<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to your address, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p> Significantly Not As Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller's description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as \"new\" but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\nit is counterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn't receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was materially damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially similar to the seller's description of it.<\/li>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as \"used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIneligible items and transactions under PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in all or part of a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller's store location.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government agency.<\/li>\n<li>Stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal payments.\n<\/li>\n<li>Payments sent using PayPal to any bill payment service.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay or guest checkout transactions (i.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account).<\/li>\n<li>Send payment transactions where the sender pays the PayPal transaction fee.<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nTransaction eligibility for PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.\n<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Centre within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, and follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nOur online dispute resolution process <p>If you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Centre to pursue a claim under our Buyer Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 1:<\/strong>\n<strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 2:<\/strong>\n<strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the Resolution Centre.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 3:<\/strong>\n<strong>Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 4:<\/strong>\n<strong>Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you're filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.<\/p>\nProof of delivery means: <p>For transactions that total less than $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/ or postal code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.<\/p>\n<p>For transactions that total $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery (except for buyers having a PayPal account registered: in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Iceland, Israel, or Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Signature<\/strong>\n<strong>confirmation currency

USD<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 5: PayPal will make a final decision<\/strong> (including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.<\/p>\n<p>In the event that PayPal makes a final decision in favour of the buyer or seller, each party must comply with PayPal's decision.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal finds in favour of a buyer, PayPal will reimburse the buyer for the full purchase price of the item and original shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>In a seller loses a claim, the seller will not receive a refund on the PayPal fees associated with the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If a seller loses a Significantly Not as Described claim due to the item sold being counterfeit, the seller will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you will not receive the item back.<\/p>\nDispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a credit card or debit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don't qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Buyer Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can't do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we'll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won't affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).\nBefore contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller's return policy.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSelling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services Receiving personal payments <p>The ability to receive payments varies by country/region.\nYou can determine whether you have the ability to receive payments by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.<\/li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you a personal payment for a purchase.\nIf you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account's ability to accept payments from friends or family members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Terms.<\/p>\nNo surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.<\/p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, wherever PayPal’s branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal’s services or marks.<\/p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal service as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over any PayPal service.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising and other customer communications), you agree to display the PayPal services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.<\/p>\nTaxes, information reporting <p>Some of our fees may be subject to applicable taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including, for example, value-added tax, sales tax, income tax, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, \"taxes\") and, unless expressly noted, our fees are exclusive of applicable taxes.\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.<\/p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy, where required by law.<\/p>\nPayment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you by email and/or through your PayPal account.<\/p> In-store payments <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace's or the third party application's buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a \"card not present\" transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.<\/p>\nAccepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer's account through preauthorized payments either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer, \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers:<\/p>\n<p>You must:<\/p>\n<p>You must not:<\/p>\n<p>Get each buyer's prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.<\/p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer's written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancellation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.<\/p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.<\/p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer's option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.<\/p> Automatic Transfer Countries <p>If you are a resident of an Automatic Transfer Country, then you have the ability to receive payments, but you must withdraw the full amount of your payment through an available withdrawal method.\nIf you do not do so, the amounts will be automatically withdrawn from your PayPal account to your withdrawal method on a regular basis.\nFor additional terms regarding Automatic Transfer, please click here.<\/p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments Standard transactions fees <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on the buyer's country/region.\nThe fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Commercial Payments Fees table.\nPlease note that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 14 days' advance notice of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.<\/li>\n<li>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.<\/li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Merchant rate <p>To qualify for our merchant rate, you must submit a one-time application, have a qualifying monthly sales volume, and have a business account in good standing.\nTo view Merchant rate criteria click here.<\/p>\nMicropayments Fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10 USD.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative PayPal balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the <strong>Micropayment Fees table<\/strong> will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of the Commercial Payments Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.<\/p>\n<p>By applying for Micropayments for Digital Goods, you agree that for digital goods transactions you receive up to the amounts in the <strong>table<\/strong>, then if a buyer opens a Dispute, PayPal may reverse the transaction, and remove the funds from your account without requiring the buyer to escalate the dispute to a claim.<\/p>\nPayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal's Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal business account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand<\/li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.\n<\/p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay services, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.<\/p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee described below).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account in the same currency as the original transaction.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.\n(This will not apply to residents of Mainland China who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.)<\/p>\n<p>The buyer's account will be credited with the full payment amount, or a portion of the payment amount in the event of a partial refund, we'll retain the fixed fee portion of the fees you paid, and the amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.<\/p>\nPayments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Buyer Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.<\/li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven't opted out).<\/li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer's bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.<\/li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized.<\/li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement, the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy or any other agreement between you and PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of the payment sent to you may be calculated in that currency, using PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover your liability for the payment amount plus the fees, then this will result in a negative PayPal balance.\nAny negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your PayPal balance to eliminate it.\nIf you do not do so, PayPal may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>recover any amounts due to PayPal by debiting your balance;<\/li>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you;<\/li>\n<li>take any and all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nDispute fees<p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout<strong>.\n<\/strong>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee <\/strong>rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee <\/strong>rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> amount will be determined when the dispute is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your disputes ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions<\/strong>\n<strong>, <\/strong>and all chargebacks from the buyer’s card issuer or reversals from the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>If your Disputes Ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.<\/p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee <\/strong>for disputes that are<em>:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal’s Seller Protection<\/strong> program.<\/li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a <strong>Standard Dispute fee.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>Decided in your favour by PayPal or your issuer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees <\/strong>may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.<\/p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.<\/p>\n<p>This Dispute fees section does not apply to residents of Malaysia who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\nChargeback fees<p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, PayPal will charge you a chargeback fee for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee will apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.<\/p>\n<p>The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is the amount specified on the Chargeback Fees table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the Chargeback fee table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.<\/p>\n<p>If a buyer files a chargeback, the card issuer, not PayPal, will determine who wins the chargeback.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee Table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the Chargeback Fee Table the fee assessed in your primary holding currency.<\/p>\nImpact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal's Buyer Protection program and if you sell goods and services to and receive payments from buyers with PayPal accounts in countries/regions other than your own, you should also be familiar with the PayPal Buyer Protection available to buyers in each of those countries/regions.\nBuyers' rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find this information for PayPal's programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer's location at the top of the page and referring to the applicable user agreement for that geography.<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal's Buyer Protection program in any country/region:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be required to reimburse PayPal for your liability.<\/li>\n<li>Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back), and the PayPal fees that you were charged for the transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay's decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover such claim.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>We offer Seller Protection based on the Seller Protection program for the country/region you selected when you opened your account.\nThe Seller Protection program for the following countries/regions are part of this user agreement.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Central Europe, Middle East and Africa<\/strong> (excluding Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other countries covered by a country/region-specific User Agreement)<\/li>\n<\/ul> What's eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under <strong>Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks<\/strong>, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal's Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal's Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize or benefit from funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an \"<strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>\" and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They did not receive the item from you (referred to as an \"<strong>Item Not Received<\/strong>\" claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer's bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal's Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the <strong>Impact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers<\/strong>.<\/p>\nBasic requirements<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You provide us with valid proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a tangible item except for items subject to the Intangible Goods Additional Requirements.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Centre.\nIf you do not respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>You must accept payment from a PayPal account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).<\/li>\n<li>The payment must be marked “eligible” or “partially eligible” in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims, for PayPal's Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nItem Not Received additional requirement<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection program for a buyer's Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked \"eligible\" or \"partially eligible\" for PayPal's Seller Protection on the transaction details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements:<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third-party or if you have a native app integration.<\/li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>Paid standard transaction fees on the sale.<\/li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of shipment or delivery for Intangible Goods.<\/li>\n<li>Provide signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table.\nIf the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nEstablishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods:<\/p>\n<p>Proof of shipment<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery<\/p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the transaction details page<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of delivery and \"delivered\" status of the item or service.<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<li>Signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes exceeds) the fixed amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table .\nSignature confirmation is online documentation, viewable at the shipping company's website, indicating that the item was signed for (save for Sellers having a PayPal Account registered in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT<\/strong>: Your choice of carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.\nPlease ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide ‘delivered' status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for intangible goods:<\/p>\n<p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.\nCompelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Received or accessed by the

connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.<\/p>\n<p>In order to facilitate PayPal’s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal’s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.<\/p>\nHolds<p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the funds shall not be available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.<\/li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.<\/li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHolds based on PayPal’s risk decisions<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe'll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.\n<\/p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 30 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account unless PayPal has a reason to continue to hold the payment.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you've uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 30 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we'll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved.<\/p>\nHolds related to Marketplace transactions<p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third-party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third-party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third-party directly.<\/p>\nHolds based on disputed transactions<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we'll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we'll remove the funds from your PayPal account.<\/p>\nAccount Limitations<p>Limitations prevent you from completing certain actions with your PayPal account, such as withdrawing, sending or receiving payments.\nThese limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why we may limit your access to your PayPal account or the PayPal services, and/or limit access to your funds, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we'll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.<\/li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you've received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks selling an entirely new or high cost product, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we limit access to your PayPal account, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and the opportunity to request restoration of access if, in our sole discretion, we deem it appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>\nReserves<p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some of the transactions will be shown as \"pending\" in your PayPal balance, and you will not be able to withdraw funds in a \"pending\" status, in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors, and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, we'll notify you of our actions and the terms of the reserve.<\/p>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve<\/strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the funds you receive on day 1 are held and then released on day 91, 10% of the funds you receive on day 2 are held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve<\/strong> is a specific minimum amount that you're required to keep available in your PayPal balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we'll notify you of the new terms.\n<\/p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place as long as reasonably necessary as determined by PayPal.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nLiability for Unauthorized Transactions Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n<\/p>\nWhat is an Unauthorized Transaction<p>An \"Unauthorized Transaction\" occurs when a payment is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.<\/p>\nWhat is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction<p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nReporting an Unauthorized Transaction<p>You should contact PayPal customer service immediately if you believe:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>there has been an Unauthorized Transaction sent from your account;<\/li>\n<li>there has been unauthorized access to your account;<\/li>\n<li>your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen.\nor<\/li>\n<li>any device you have used to access your PayPal account has been lost, stolen or deactivated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You must give us all the available information relating to circumstances of any Unauthorized Transactions, and/or misappropriated or unauthorized use of your account, and take all reasonable steps requested to assist PayPal in its investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If you notify us of an Unauthorized Transaction within 60 days of the transaction and we are satisfied that it was an Unauthorized Transaction, you will be eligible for 100% protection for the Unauthorized Transaction.<\/p> Error Resolution What is an Error<p>An \"Error\" means the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a processing error made by PayPal or its suppliers in which your PayPal account is mistakenly debited or credited, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.<\/li>\n<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nWhat is not considered an Error<p>The following are NOT considered errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>If you erroneously send a payment to the wrong party, or send a payment for the wrong amount (based on a typographical error, for example).\n(Your only recourse in this instance will be to contact the party to whom you sent the payment and ask them to refund the payment.\nPayPal will not reimburse you or reverse a payment that you have made in error.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIn case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers<p>Contact us at our Resolution Centre.<\/p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name, email address and account number (if any).<\/li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.<\/li>\n<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.\nWe will complete our investigation within 10 Business Days after we receive your notification of the suspected error.\nIf we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, we will credit your PayPal account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the provisional credit during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nWe will notify you of the provisional credit within 2 Business Days of the crediting.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not provisionally credit your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nFor new PayPal accounts (the first transaction from your account was less than 30 Business Days from the date you notify us), we may take up to 20 Business Days to complete the investigation.<\/p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation of our decision.\nIf you received a provisional credit, we will remove it from your account and notify you of the date and amount of the debit.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If we determine that there was an error, we will promptly credit the full amount into your account within 1 Business Day of our determination.\nOr, if you have already received a provisional credit, you will be allowed to retain those amounts.<\/p> Processing Errors <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover.\nIf the error results in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You receive less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.<\/li>\n<li>You receive more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.<\/li>\n<li>Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: <ul>\n<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;<\/li>\n<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/li>\n<li>the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Processing errors are not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.<\/li>\n<li>Delays based on a payment review.<\/li>\n<li>Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.<\/li>\n<li>Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount that you are sending).<\/li>\n<\/ul> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nOther Legal Terms Communications Between You and Us <p>You agree that PayPal and its affiliates may contact you by email for marketing purposes.\nYou may opt-out of receiving marketing communications when you open a PayPal account, by changing your account preferences or by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any PayPal email or receipt you receive from us.\nPlease allow up to 10 Business Days for the opt-out to take effect.\nWe will provide factual information about your account or the PayPal services, even if you have opted-out of receiving marketing communications.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide us your mobile phone number, you agree that PayPal and its affiliates may contact you at that number using autodialed or prerecorded message calls or text messages to: (i) inform you about your use of the PayPal services and/or service your PayPal accounts, (ii) investigate or prevent fraud, or (iii) collect a debt.\nWe will not use autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to contact you for marketing purposes unless we receive your prior consent.\nWe may share your mobile phone number with service providers with whom we contract to assist us with the activities listed above, but will not share your mobile phone number with third parties for their own purposes without your consent.\nYou do not have to agree to receive autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to your mobile phone number in order to use and enjoy the products and services offered by PayPal.\nYou can decline to receive autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to your mobile phone number in several ways, including, via an email transaction receipt, in your account settings, or by contacting PayPal Customer Service.\nHowever, we may still call you directly using other means if we need to speak with you.\nStandard telephone minute and text charges may apply.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal may communicate with you about any PayPal account or transaction information and the PayPal services electronically.\nIt is your responsibility to keep your primary email address up to date so that PayPal can communicate with you electronically.\nYou understand and agree that if PayPal sends you an electronic communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic communications, PayPal will be deemed to have provided the communication to you effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add PayPal to your email address book so that you will be able to view the communications we send to you.<\/p>\n<p>You can update your primary email address or street address at any time by logging into the PayPal website.\nIf your email address becomes invalid such that electronic communications sent to you by PayPal are returned, PayPal may deem your account to be inactive, and you will not be able to transact any activity using your PayPal Account until we receive a valid, working primary email address from you.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal reserves the right to close your account if you withdraw your consent to receive electronic communications.<\/p>\n<p>You will be considered to have received a communication from us, if it's delivered electronically, 24 hours after the time we post it to our website or email it to you.\nYou will be considered to have received a communication from us, if it's delivered by mail, 3 Business Days after we send it.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you're communicating with us about a matter where we've specified another notice address (for example, our Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors process), written notices to PayPal must be sent by postal mail to: PayPal Pte.\nLtd., Attention: Legal Department, 5 Temasek Boulevard #09-01, Suntec Tower Five, Singapore 038985.<\/p>\n<p>You understand and agree that, to the extent permitted by law, PayPal may, without further notice or warning, monitor or record telephone conversations you or anyone acting on your behalf has with PayPal or its agents for quality control and training purposes or for our own protection.\nYou acknowledge and understand that while your communications with PayPal may be overheard, monitored, or recorded not all telephone lines or calls may be recorded by PayPal, and PayPal does not guarantee that recordings of any particular telephone calls will be retained or retrievable.<\/p> PayPal's Rights PayPal suspension and termination rights <p>PayPal, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to suspend or terminate this user agreement, access to or use of its websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services)

unrestricted funds held in your PayPal balance.<\/p> Security interest <p>As security for the performance of your obligations under this user agreement, you grant to PayPal a lien on, and security interest in and to, your PayPal balance in the possession of PayPal.<\/p>\nAmounts owed to PayPal <p>If your PayPal balance becomes negative for any reason, that negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to PayPal.\nPayPal may set off these amounts from funds that are subsequently added to your PayPal account, either by you or from payments you receive.\nIf you have more than one PayPal account, we may set off a negative PayPal balance in one PayPal account against a PayPal balance in your other PayPal account(s).\nIf you continue using your PayPal account when it has a negative balance, you authorize PayPal to combine the negative balance with any debit or transaction sent from your account when that combination is disclosed to you in advance of initiating the debit or transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold funds in a PayPal account in multiple currencies, and the balance for one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, PayPal may set off the negative PayPal balance by using funds you maintain in a different currency.\nIf you have a negative balance in non-relevant currency for a period of 21 days or longer, PayPal will convert this negative balance to relevant currency.\nIn either case, a currency conversion will be necessary, and PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the above, if you have a past due amount owed to PayPal, our affiliates, or eBay, PayPal may debit your PayPal account to pay any amounts that are past due.\nThis includes amounts owed by using our various products such as Xoom or Braintree.<\/p>\nInsolvency proceedings<p>If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of any bankruptcy or insolvency law, we'll be entitled to recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this user agreement.<\/p>\nAssumption of rights<p>If PayPal invalidates and reverses a payment that you made to a recipient (either at your initiative or otherwise), you agree that PayPal assumes your rights against the recipient and third parties related to the payment, and may pursue those rights directly or on your behalf, in PayPal's discretion.<\/p>\nNo waiver<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under this user agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.<\/p> Indemnification and Limitation of Liability <p>In this section, we use the term \"PayPal\" to refer to PayPal Pte.\nLtd.\nand our affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, joint ventures, service providers and suppliers.\nOur affiliates include each entity that we control, we are controlled by or we are under common control with.<\/p>\nIndemnification<p>You must indemnify PayPal for actions related to your PayPal account and your use of the PayPal services.\nYou agree to defend, indemnify and hold PayPal harmless from any claim or demand (including reasonable legal fees) made or incurred by any third party due to or arising out of

grant permissions to use your PayPal account or access our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, or any of the PayPal services on your behalf.<\/p>\nLimitation of liability<p>\n<strong>PayPal's liability is limited with respect to your PayPal account and your use of the PayPal services.<\/strong>

significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.\n&nbsp;For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp.\nWhen you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp.\nExamples of account connections include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;<\/li>\n<li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials.\nor<\/li>\n<li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp.\nFor example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp.\nIf you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.\n&nbsp;We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp.\nBefore authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp.\nFor example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp;<\/p> 7.&nbsp;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?&nbsp.\n<p>When you visit our Sites, use

FOR PAYPAL PAYMENT CARD FUNDED PROCESSING SERVICES &nbsp.\n<p>This Commercial Entity Agreement for PayPal Payment Card Funded Processing Services (“Commercial Entity Agreement” or \"CEA\") is agreed with all PayPal Users that are Commercial Entities (as defined by Visa Europe, Visa Inc, Visa International, Mastercard Worldwide, UK Maestro, Solo and/or International Maestro (together the \"Associations\")).\nEach such PayPal User is referred to as “Merchant” and may be referred to herein as “you” and/or “your”.\nThis CEA constitutes your separate legally binding contract for credit and debit card processing for PayPal transactions between you and the Acquirer (as defined below).<\/p>\n<p>For the purposes of this CEA, \"Acquirer\" shall mean (a) Worldpay (UK) Limited if Merchant is based in Europe.\nand/or (b) Worldpay PTE Ltd if Merchant is based in Singapore.\nand/or (c) Worldpay (HK) Limited if Merchant is based in Hong Kong.\nand/or (d) Citizens Bank, N.A.\nif Merchant is based in the United States and/or (d) Worldpay PTY.\nLtd if Merchant is based in Australia.\nIn this CEA \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" refer to Acquirer.<\/p>\n<p>In accordance with the provisions of this CEA, Acquirer may terminate its provision of credit and debit card processing services and require PayPal to enforce any of the provisions of Merchant’s agreement(s) with PayPal (\"PayPal Agreement\"), agreed by and between Merchant and PayPal.<\/p>\n<p>Merchant agrees to the terms and conditions of this CEA.\nMerchant further agrees that this CEA forms a legally binding contract between Merchant and Acquirer.\nPayPal is not a party to this contract and acts only as Acquirer’s agent in connection with it.\nIf we propose to change this CEA in a substantial manner, PayPal will provide you on our behalf with at least 30 days' (or such minimum period as is required by law) prior notice of such a change.\nAfter the notice period elapses, you will be deemed to have agreed to all such amendments to the CEA.\nTo amend this CEA but not in a substantial manner, PayPal will post on our behalf a revised version of the CEA on the PayPal website(s), and the revised version will be effective at the time PayPal posts it.\n&nbsp;If you disagree with any proposed amendments, you may close your PayPal account before the expiry of the notice &nbsp;period provided in the notice and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the PayPal Agreement, and this CEA will terminate on the closure of your account.\nA change to this CEA will be considered to be made in a “substantial manner” if the change involves a reduction to your rights or increases your responsibilities.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Purpose of this CEA.<\/strong> When your customers pay you through PayPal, they have the option of paying you through a funding source supported by PayPal including a card.\nIn most instances, you will not know the funding source that your customer selected.\nSince you may be the recipient of a card funded payment, the Associations require that you enter into a direct contractual relationship with an acquirer who is a member of the Associations.\nBy entering into this CEA, you are fulfilling such Association requirement and you are agreeing to comply with Association rules as they pertain to payments you receive through the PayPal service.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Obligations of Acquirer.&nbsp.\n<\/strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Acquirer’s obligations under this CEA are limited exclusively to the processing of Merchant's card transactions in the territory in which the Merchant is based and the receipt and disbursement of related funds to PayPal for the account of the Merchant (the “Acquiring Services”).&nbsp.\nAll other obligations relating to the provision of the services under the PayPal Agreement are the responsibility of PayPal and any issue, dissatisfaction, dispute and/or service dispute of the Merchant relating to any services provided to the Merchant should be notified to and brought against PayPal in the first instance.<\/li>\n<li>Subject to the terms of this CEA and the PayPal Agreement, Acquirer will initiate a payment to the designated account (as made known to Acquirer by PayPal) of an amount equal to the value of card transactions processed by Acquirer for the Merchant under this CEA (less deductions for refunds, fines, assessments, chargebacks, chargeback costs, fees or other Merchant liabilities (whether actual or anticipated) under this CEA or the PayPal Agreement).\n&nbsp;Any obligation of Acquirer to remit funds under this CEA is subject to any rights of Acquirer under its agreement with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Merchant agrees that any payment made to PayPal by Acquirer under this CEA will be deemed good receipt by Merchant of the sums due from Acquirer to Merchant in relation to Acquirer’s liability to Merchant under this CEA.\nMerchant shall indemnify Acquirer and keep Acquirer indemnified against all losses, costs, claims, demands, expenses (including legal expenses) and liabilities of any nature (including any re-settlement obligations under the Association rules) arising from or relating to the payment of funds by Acquirer into an account in the name of PayPal in accordance with the terms of this CEA.<\/li>\n<li>Throughout the term of this CEA and after its termination for any reason, Acquirer shall be entitled to defer (for such period as it shall in its reasonable discretion consider appropriate) the date upon which the payment of funds in respect of card transactions would (but for this clause) be due in order to protect its position with respect to actual or anticipated chargebacks, fines, assessments, refunds, chargeback costs, fees, fraud, illegal activity or any other liability of Merchant or relating to any card transactions or under this CEA or the PPA, whether actual or anticipated.&nbsp.\nAmounts so deferred may be set-off against any actual chargebacks, fines, assessments, refunds, chargeback costs, fees or any other liability of Merchant.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nThe Merchant understands and acknowledges that during the term of this CEA and after its termination for any reason whatsoever, the Merchant shall continue to bear total responsibility for all chargebacks, chargeback costs, refunds, fines, assessments, fees, fraud and illegal activity resulting in any way from card transactions processed pursuant to this CEA and all other amounts then due or which thereafter may become due under this CEA or the PayPal Agreement.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Association Rules.<\/strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Deposit Transactions.<\/strong> Merchant agrees that it shall only accept payments through PayPal processing services for bona fide transactions between the Merchant and its customer for the sale of goods or services.\nMerchant shall not submit a transaction for the refinance or transfer of an existing obligation that was uncollectible.\nMerchant acknowledges that for Visa and Mastercard payments, PayPal shall obtain an authorization for transaction amounts prior to completing the transaction.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Split Transactions.<\/strong> Merchant agrees not to split the sale into two (or more) separate amounts in order to avoid obtaining authorization for the full amount.\nExcept, however in an instance where the Merchant and cardholder agree on a partial shipment of product, or where the transaction qualifies for delayed delivery or special order deposits (such as partial shipments based on inventory on hand), a sale may be split into multiple transactions.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Minimum or Maximum/Surcharges.<\/strong> Merchant agrees that it shall not set minimum or maximum transaction amounts or impose surcharges as a condition of honoring Visa and Mastercard cards, unless otherwise permitted in the particular jurisdiction of a transaction.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Visa and Mastercard Marks.<\/strong> Merchant is authorized to and must use the Visa and Mastercard logos or marks on Merchant’s promotional materials and website to indicate that Visa and Mastercard cards are accepted as funding sources for PayPal transactions.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Discrimination.<\/strong> Merchant agrees that it shall not engage in any acceptance practice that discriminates against or discourages the use of Visa or Mastercard in favour of any other card brand unless otherwise permitted in the particular jurisdiction of a transaction.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Access to Cardholder Data.<\/strong> Merchant acknowledges that where it has access to Cardholder Data (defined as the cardholder’s card number, expiration date, and CVV2) it will abide by any data security standards of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (or any replacement body), Visa or Mastercard, including the Payment Card Industry SSC Standards.\nIn addition you agree to comply with the data security standards required by PayPal under the PayPal Agreement, as may be amended from time to time.&nbsp.\n.\nIn the event that Merchant receives Cardholder Data in connection with the PayPal processing services, Merchant agrees that it will not use the Cardholder Data for any purpose that it knows or should know to be fraudulent or in violation of any Association rules.\nMerchant also agrees that it will not sell, purchase, provide or exchange in any manner or disclose Cardholder Data to anyone other than its acquirer, Visa or Mastercard (as applicable) or in response to a government request.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Merchant Identification.<\/strong> Merchant agrees to prominently and unequivocally inform the cardholder of the identity of the Merchant at all points of interaction including the location (physical address) of the Merchant to enable the cardholder to easily determine whether the transaction will be a domestic transaction or a cross-border transaction.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Chargebacks.<\/strong> Merchant shall use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with the cardholder.\nShould a chargeback dispute occur, Merchant shall promptly comply with all requests for information from PayPal.\nMerchant shall not attempt to recharge a cardholder for an item that has been charged back to the cardholder, unless the cardholder has authorized such actions.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Merchant’s Refund Policy must be on Merchant’s Website.<\/strong> If Merchant limits refund/exchange terms or other specific conditions for Card sales, Merchant’s policy must be clearly provided to the cardholder prior to the sale and Merchant must conform with all applicable laws and the Association rules.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Audit<\/strong>.&nbsp.\nUpon Acquirer’s request, the Merchant must promptly disclose to Acquirer such information as Acquirer reasonably requires in order to enable Acquirer to perform its obligations, and/or assess its financial and insurance risks in connection with the services provided, and/or to assess the Merchant’s compliance with the terms of the CEA and/or the Association rules.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Term and Termination.<\/strong> This CEA is effective upon the date the PayPal Agreement between Merchant and PayPal comes into force and continues so long as the PayPal Agreement remains in force between Merchant and PayPal but shall automatically terminate without notice on termination of such PayPal Agreement for any reason, provided that those terms which by their nature are intended to survive termination (including without limitation, indemnification obligations and limitations of liability) shall survive.\nThis CEA may be terminated by Acquirer at any time in the event of a breach of any of Merchant’s obligations under this CEA or the PayPal Agreement, or by Merchant in the event of a breach of any of Acquirer’s obligations under this CEA, or by Acquirer in the event of the termination of the acquiring services agreement entered into between PayPal (or its applicable group company) and Acquirer as notified to the Merchant.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Indemnification.<\/strong> Merchant agrees to indemnify and hold Acquirer harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages and expense: (a) resulting from any breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement or any misrepresentation by Merchant under this CEA.\n(b) arising out of Merchant’s or its employees’ negligence or willful misconduct, (c) arising in connection with Card transactions or otherwise arising from Merchant’s provision of goods and services to Cardholders or customers.\n(d) arising out of Merchant’s use of the PayPal Service.\nor (e) resulting from any fines or arising out of any third party indemnifications&nbsp;Acquirer is obligated to make as a result of Merchant’s actions (including indemnification of any Association or Card issuing bank).<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Assignment/Amendments.<\/strong> This CEA may not be assigned by Merchant without the prior written consent of Acquirer.\nAcquirer may assign its rights under this CEA without Merchant’s consent.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Warranty Disclaimer.<\/strong> This CEA is a service agreement.\nAcquirer disclaims all representations or warranties, express or implied, made to Merchant or any other person, including without limitation, any warranties regarding quality, suitability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or otherwise of any services or any goods provided incidental to the services provided under this CEA to the extent permitted by law.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Limitation of Liability.<\/strong> Notwithstanding anything in this CEA to the contrary, in no event shall Acquirer, or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or subcontractors, be liable under any theory of tort, contract, strict liability or other legal theory for lost profits, lost revenues, lost business opportunities, exemplary, punitive, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages, each of which is hereby excluded by agreement of the parties, regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable or whether Acquirer has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\nNotwithstanding anything in this CEA to the contrary, in no event shall Acquirer be liable or responsible for any delays or errors in its performance of the services caused by its service providers or other parties or events outside of Acquirer’s reasonable control, including PayPal.\nNotwithstanding anything in this CEA to the contrary, Acquirer’s cumulative liability for all losses, claims, suits, controversies, breaches or damages for any cause whatsoever arising out of or related to this CEA and regardless of the form of action or legal theory and

PayPal.\nNothing in this CEA shall exclude or limit any liability of any party for death or personal injury caused by negligence or fraud, deceit or fraudulent misrepresentation, howsoever caused.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Waiver.<\/strong> The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this CEA, including, but not limited to, the right to terminate this CEA in the event of breach or default by the other party, will not be deemed to constitute a waiver by that party of its right to enforce each and every provision of this CEA in accordance with its terms.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relationship between the Parties.<\/strong> No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment relationship is created between Merchant and Acquirer by way of this CEA.\nIn the performance of their respective obligations hereunder, the parties are, and will be, independent contractors.\nNothing in this CEA will be construed to constitute either party as the agent for the other for any purpose whatsoever.\nNeither party will bind, or attempt to bind, the other party to any contract or the performance of any obligation, and neither party will represent to

utilize the Acquiring Services for illegal purposes and will not interfere or disrupt networks connected with the Acquiring Services.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severability.<\/strong> Whenever possible, each provision of this CEA will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision hereof will be prohibited by or determined to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of

Transfer allows you to receive payments into your PayPal account and have those amounts automatically transferred to your linked US bank account or Visa credit card.\nAll payments that you receive are

payments into your PayPal account, you must link your US bank account or Visa credit card to your PayPal account and complete PayPal’s credit card and/or bank account verification process.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> 2.\nAutomatic Transfer: <ol>\n<li>On a regular basis, PayPal will automatically transfer the amounts from your available PayPal Balance to your US bank account or Visa credit card.<\/li>\n<li>The automatic transfer will occur within the first 3 days of each month, quarter, or applicable period in the country in which you reside.<\/li>\n<li>There is no fee for automatic transfers to your US bank account or Visa credit card.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> 3.\nManual Transfer and Fee: <ol>\n<li>If you do not want to wait for the automatic transfer, you may

fee.<\/li>\n<li>Manual transfers to your US bank account are free.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> 4.\nPayment Hold Period: <ol>\n<li>All payments that you receive will be subject to an

funds will be released to your available balance unless PayPal is holding the amounts for another reason as specified in the PayPal User Agreement, or other agreement that you have entered into with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal, in its sole discretion, may determine that you are no longer subject to an initial 30 day hold period.\nIn such an event, payments you receive into your PayPal account will appear in your available balance soon after you receive the payment.\nPayPal will base its decision to remove the 30 day hold period on a number of factors including but not limited to the following: the length of time you have been a PayPal customer, the type of goods or services that you sell, and the number of customer complaints that you receive.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> 5.\nWithdrawal

instrument that you linked to your PayPal account for automatic transfers.\n<ol>\n<li>This means that if you link a Visa credit card to your PayPal account one day, and then link a second Visa credit card to your account the next day, PayPal will use the first Visa credit card for the automatic transfer.<\/li>\n<li>You may change this by going to the “Profile” page, selecting “Manage Automatic Transfer”, and following the instructions to select your preferred financial instrument for automatic transfers.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>If you remove your US bank account and/or Visa credit card, PayPal will request that you add a new financial instrument to your PayPal account.\nIf you do not do so, you will lose the ability to receive payments.<\/li>\n<li>If PayPal is unable to transfer your balance to your US bank account and/or Visa credit card for any reason, then PayPal will give you a limited amount of time to add a new financial instrument to your PayPal account.\nIf you do not do so, you will lose the ability to receive payments.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> 7.\nRestriction on Sending Payments: <ol>\n<li>You may use your credit card to send payments.\nYou may not use your PayPal balance or US bank account to send payments.\nAll amounts in your available PayPal balance must be withdrawn from your PayPal account through automatic and/or manual

effective for all users as of November 9, 2020.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to PayPal!<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal, Inc.\ngoverning your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nIt applies to U.S.\nPayPal accounts only.\nIf you are an individual, you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your state of residence to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of, the United States or one of its territories to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nThe terms include an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration on an individual basis.\nYou also agree to comply with each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you and the following additional policies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>Electronic Communications Delivery Policy (E-Sign Disclosure and Consent)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may revise this agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you at least 21 days advance notice for personal accounts and at least 5 days advance notice for business accounts.\nBy continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement, you agree to abide and be bound by those changes.\nIf you do not agree with any changes to this user agreement, you may close your account.<\/p> Opening a PayPal Account <p>We offer two types of PayPal accounts: personal PayPal accounts and business PayPal accounts, both covered by this user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive money.<\/li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.<\/li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, or other payment options, including funds held as balance in a business PayPal account (if we have verified the required identifying information you provide to us) or funds held in a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account linked to a personal PayPal account if you choose to open a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nThe term “Cash Account” in this user agreement will be used to refer to either a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, Cash Account and other payment methods from others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nYou must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Personal PayPal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send money to family and friends, a personal PayPal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal PayPal account you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and request money from friends and family.<\/li>\n<li>Buy goods and services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also use a personal PayPal account to receive money for the sale of goods and services and hold that money in a linked Cash Account or transfer it to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not open a Cash Account, but if you plan to use your personal PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should open a business PayPal account.\nYou can also convert your personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account should circumstances change.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Business PayPal accounts <p>We recommend business PayPal accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services or accept donations, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business PayPal account, you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your business PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your business PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Business PayPal accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business PayPal account or converting a personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business PayPal account.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Commercial Entity Status <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your PayPal account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to a personal PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any funds held in your Cash Account before closing your personal PayPal account, and closing a personal PayPal account will result in PayPal automatically closing any linked Cash Account.\nIf you have a business PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any balance from your business PayPal account before closing it, and if you have not provided the required identifying information to us, or if we are unable to verify the required identifying information you provide, you must transfer any balance in your business PayPal account to a linked bank account or debit card.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your personal or business PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.<\/p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink certain payment methods such as a credit card, debit card, a U.S.\nbank account or PayPal Credit to your PayPal account.\nYou can also link a Cash Account to your personal PayPal account as a payment method and unlink the Cash Account by withdrawing all funds and closing it.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.\nTo do this, we will charge $1.95 to the card.\nAfter the card is confirmed, we will immediately refund this amount to the card.<\/p> Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds Personal PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to your personal PayPal account cannot be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nWhen you receive money to your personal PayPal account, you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transfer the money via a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your personal PayPal account for free;<\/li>\n<li>transfer the money via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your personal PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for

office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you;<\/li>\n<li>open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nA Cash Account is separate account from your personal PayPal account.\nIf you open a Cash Account, we will automatically link your Cash Account to your personal PayPal account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You also cannot transfer money to your personal PayPal account to be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nYou will need to open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account, which can be used for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Except as provided below, any balance in your Cash Account and any funds sent to you which have not yet been transferred to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not have

a PayPal Cash Card debit card as part of a Cash Account, have enrolled in Direct Deposit, or have established Goals in PayPal, such funds will have pass-through FDIC insurance as further detailed in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Business PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to a business PayPal account can be held directly as balance in the business PayPal account.\nThe balance functionality in your business PayPal account will differ depending on whether we have been able to verify the required identifying information that you provide to us.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>The required identifying information is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For sole proprietorships: name, physical address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number.\nor<\/li>\n<li>For other types of business legal entities: business name, business address, taxpayer identification number, and proof of business existence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we have not verified the required identifying information, a balance in your business PayPal account can only be held in your business PayPal account and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card or you can request PayPal to send you the money by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nYour balance may also be used to fund payments or money owed to PayPal, such as payments on your PayPal Working Capital account or monies owed for refunds or chargebacks.<\/p>\n<p>If we have verified the required identifying information, a balance can be held in your business PayPal account, transferred to a linked bank account or debit card, used to make purchases or send money to others.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a business PayPal account and we have verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you may transfer money to the balance of your business PayPal account from any bank account linked to your business PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer from your bank account.\nIf we have not verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you cannot add funds to your balance in a business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>You can withdraw balance from your business PayPal account by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it via a standard transfer to a bank account linked to your business PayPal account for free,<\/li>\n<li>transferring it via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your business PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal,<\/li>\n<li>withdrawing it from an ATM (automated teller machine) if you have a PayPal-branded debit card (fees may apply), or<\/li>\n<li>Requesting a check from us (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nIf you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your balance in your business PayPal account and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.\nWe will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Any balance you hold in your business account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<\/p>\n<p>PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.\nYou will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.\nPayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.\nPayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nHowever, the claim against PayPal represented by your PayPal funds is not secured by these investments and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from PayPal’s corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Restrictions on transfers or withdrawals from PayPal accounts <p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting two out of three of the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit or debit card information.<\/li>\n<li>Providing your social security number.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies Holding currency other than U.S.\ndollars <p>Your balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, if you have one, may be held in currencies other than U.S.\ndollars.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the funds to balance in another currency.\nIf you convert funds in your account, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.<\/li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the funds in U.S.\ndollars.\nIn order to withdraw funds in your account held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to U.S.\ndollars, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal’s currency conversion rate, including our currency conversion spread, will be used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To receive money in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, in that currency or convert the money into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the money into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the money is converted, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal Cash Account or business PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion spread applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).<\/p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe applicable currency conversion spread can be found on our Fees page under the heading Currency conversion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines a currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorize PayPal to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nCurrency preference selections may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, and may be made available individually for each card and for each automatic payment agreement.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where your Cash Account balance, business PayPal account balance or linked bank account is the payment method.<\/p> Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, you will receive two statements: one showing all transactions in your personal PayPal account and an additional statement showing only transactions involving your Cash Account.<\/p> Sending Money and Buying Sending Money to a Friend or Family Member Sending money <p>You can send money to a friend or family member using the send money feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called “personal payments” or “peer-to-peer/P2P payments”).\nYou can send money to a friend or family member even if they don’t have a PayPal account at the time you send them money, using their email address or mobile number in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don’t claim it, it will be refunded to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can send, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>When you send money to a friend or family member who has a PayPal account, one of two things may happen: they may accept or decline the money.\nIf they decline to accept the money, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card, PayPal Credit, a Cash Account, or balance in a business PayPal account as the payment method, or<\/li>\n<li>The balance in your business PayPal account or the balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account if you used a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>If you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending money can be found on our Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family page and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send money to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert money in your Cash Account balance or in your business PayPal account balance from one currency to another before sending money, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nIf you use your credit card as the payment method when sending money, you may also be charged a cash-advance fee by your card issuer.<\/p>\n<p>If you send money to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party’s product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the send money feature in your PayPal account to pay for goods or services.\nYou will not be charged any transaction fee for sending money to purchase goods or services as long as you choose the “send money to pay for goods and services” feature in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, the seller will pay a fee.\nYou must not use the “send money to a friend or family member” feature in your PayPal account when you are paying for goods or services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal <p>&nbsp;<\/p> How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, in any currency that the seller accepts and that PayPal supports using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer’s website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Sending money to a seller for goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller’s physical store using an electronic terminal, subject to certain limitations.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller’s physical store using your own mobile device and a QR code, subject to certain limitations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don’t open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.<\/p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third party websites or applications.<\/p>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a currency conversion spread) will be used, and may be the rate at the time the payment is processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Fees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal you don’t pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nYour debit or credit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for non-U.S.\ntransactions.<\/p>\n<p>In addition you may be required to pay a fee to PayPal if you are making a purchase using PayPal Business Payments and the seller discloses to you that you, as the buyer, must pay the fee.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don’t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Automatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows you to pay the seller on a one-time, recurring or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a “billing agreement,” \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>If you have a personal PayPal account, you may cancel a recurring automatic payment up to 3 <strong>Business Days<\/strong> before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the <strong>PayPal Help Center<\/strong>, or by calling PayPal at (888) 221-1161.<\/p>\n<p>Once your automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller money for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for.<\/p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal’s <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a debit card, credit card, PayPal Credit, or a balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a personal PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your linked Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a business PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your balance in your business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller’s store location that you paid for using your personal PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller’s store location that you paid for using your business PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your balance in your business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you used Pay with Rewards to fund your transaction, your refund will be processed back as a dollar amount: depending on your card agreement with your issuer, your issuer may or may not credit your purchase back to your reward balance.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal performed currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) used at the time of the original payment will apply.<\/li>\n<li>Beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) on the date of the refund will apply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Money will be refunded in the currency you paid.\nor if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.\nor we are unable to refund in your primary holding currency, then in U.S.\ndollars.<\/p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction <p>&nbsp;<\/p> Selecting a preferred payment method <p>You can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences on <strong>www.paypal.com<\/strong> or in the PayPal app.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.<\/p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions, and each of your automatic payment agreements, as described below.<\/p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.<\/p>\n<p>If no preferred payment method, it’s still your choice.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the “Manage” link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for in-store or automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Sending money to friends and family <p>When you send money to friends and family within the U.S.\nusing balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the balance in your business PayPal account, or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the “Change” link on the Send Money page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send money.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Automatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way you pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\nTo help minimize disruptions in your automatic payments, we may update your Payment Method information.\nsee Link or Unlink a Payment Method.<\/p>\n<p>When you first set up an automatic payment agreement, you may have the option to set up a preferred payment method for such agreement.\nYou can review, set, or change a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement in your account settings on paypal.com.<\/p>\n<p>Your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement will be used for transactions with that seller.\nIf you have available balance in a linked Cash or cash Plus account, that balance may be used before your preferred payment method.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not set a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement, or if your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement is unavailable (for example, because it is expired or has insufficient funds) the payment method used will be in the following order, if applicable: 1.\nCash Account (if one is linked to your personal PayPal account) or balance in your business PayPal account (if we’ve been able to verify the <strong>required identifying information<\/strong> you provide to us).\n2.\nBank account.\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\nDebit card.\n6.\nCredit card.\nand 7.\nE-check.\nThis is also the order of payment methods that will be used if a previously selected payment method to be used in a seller agreement is unavailable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Bank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.<\/p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to pay for an item and you select your bank account as the funding method for the transaction, remember that your PayPal account is issued to you by PayPal and not your bank.\nThe terms, benefits, and protections associated with your PayPal account may vary from those that apply to your bank account.\nIf you use your PayPal account to make a purchase that exceeds the balance in your linked bank account, you could incur overdraft fees, even if you chose not to allow overdrafts with your bank.\nSimilarly, the liability limits applicable to your PayPal account may differ from those applicable to your bank account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> E-check <p>E-check is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside the United States.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Pay with Rewards <p>PayPal may allow you to redeem rewards associated with your eligible card(s) when making a purchase with your PayPal account through PayPal’s Pay with Rewards program.\nPayPal may share with and receive information from your issuer about your issuer accounts to complete the redemption of your rewards when using PayPal’s Pay with Rewards program.\nThe exchange of this information is necessary to complete the purchase when you select the Pay with Rewards redemption option.<\/p> All Pay with Rewards redemptions are subject to the terms of your card agreement with your card issuer.\nPay with Rewards is only available for eligible purchases with certain merchants, and PayPal or your issuer may limit, suspend, or terminate your ability to redeem rewards at any time in accordance with this user agreement and your card agreement.\nYour issuer determines the value of rewards redeemed through PayPal and available redemption methods (e.g., to pay for your purchase or for a statement credit).\nThere may be a delay between checkout and processing of your payment.\nOnly rewards available upon processing of your payment will be used.\nBecause your reward balance and/or transaction balance may change, whenever you request to redeem rewards for a purchase you also authorize PayPal to charge up to the full payment amount to your associated card if that happens.\nFor more information on redeeming rewards and how it works, please see About Payment Methods.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Debit card processing <p>PayPal will process your debit or prepaid card funded transactions through either the ATM debit network or the Visa, MasterCard or Discover network.\nIf we process your debit or prepaid card through an ATM debit network, we may provide you with the opportunity to switch to a Visa, MasterCard or Discover network by changing your preferences for that debit or prepaid card through your PayPal account profile.<\/p> Loyalty Cards <p>If you use the PayPal application on your mobile phone, you may store loyalty card numbers or bar codes, where applicable, for certain sellers in your PayPal account.\nWhen you store your loyalty card numbers or bar codes in your PayPal account, you will earn any rewards, subject to the seller’s loyalty card terms and conditions, at the time you make your payment to the merchant by presenting the stored loyalty card number or bar code to the seller at the point of sale.\nIt is your responsibility to make sure you have entered your loyalty card information correctly and that you update it as necessary.\nIt is also your responsibility to ensure that you are receiving the rewards to which you are entitled.\nPayPal is not responsible for managing your loyalty card account by offering this service and any questions about your loyalty card or associated rewards program should be directed to the seller who offers the card.<\/p> PayPal’s Purchase Protection Program <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal’s Purchase Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Purchase Protection program.\nPayPal’s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal’s Purchase Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal’s Purchase Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn’t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn’t what you ordered (referred to as a “Significantly Not as Described” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Purchase Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <strong>\n<em>will not<\/em>\n<\/strong> qualify for a refund under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program for an Item Not Received claim, if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller’s physical store, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions, or<\/li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller’s description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as “new” but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn’t receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as “used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Purchase Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller’s store location, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government agency.<\/li>\n<li>Stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal Payments.<\/li>\n<li>Payments sent using PayPal to any bill payment service.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay or guest checkout transactions (i.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account).<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Transaction eligibility for PayPal’s Purchase Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Purchase Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment and follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you’re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> to pursue a claim under our Purchase Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.\n<\/p>\n<p>Step 3: <strong>Respond to PayPal’s requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4: <strong>Comply with PayPal’s shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you’re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery means:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For transactions that total less than $750 U.S.\ndollars (or the currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or zip code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.<\/li>\n<li>For transactions that total $750 U.S.\ndollar (or the currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Signature confirmation currency thresholds

MXN<\/p>\n<p>U.S.\nDollar:<\/p>\n<p>750 USD<\/p>\n<p>Step 5: <strong>PayPal will make a final decision <\/strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don’t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Purchase Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can’t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we’ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won’t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).<\/p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller’s return policy.<\/p> Selling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services <p>&nbsp;<\/p> Receiving personal payments <p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.<\/li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you money using the “send money to a friend or family member.” If you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account’s ability to accept payments from friends or family members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> No surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Presentation of PayPal and Pay with Venmo <p>You must treat PayPal and/or Venmo as payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale where PayPal or Venmo branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal or Venmo services or marks.\n<\/p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal or Venmo services or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal or Venmo services.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or Venmo services or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal or Venmo, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising, and other customer communications) you agree to display the PayPal or Venmo services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Taxes and information reporting <p>Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “taxes”).\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process.\nFor example, PayPal is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of payments for goods and services you receive each calendar year into all of your PayPal accounts associated with the same tax identification number if you receive more than $20,000 in payments for good and services and process more than 200 transactions involving goods or services through those PayPal accounts in the same calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Your customer service information, refunds and returns policy, and privacy policy <p>You must publish customer service information with clear instructions on how your customers can contact you.\nSuch instructions must include at least: (1) one active customer service email address or active customer service URL to file tickets for assistance and/or (2) one active customer service telephone number.\nSuch information must be readily accessible for review by your customers.<\/p>\n<p>You must publish a refunds and returns policy.<\/p>\n<p>You must publish a privacy policy, where required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal's Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you about payment reviews by email and/or through your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer’s account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes intended for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions, you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace’s or the third party application’s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> PayPal Giving Fund <p>If you are a charity and hold a PayPal account, you may be eligible to participate in PayPal Giving Fund programs.\nPayPal Giving Fund is a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code as a tax-exempt public charity (Federal Tax ID: 45-0931286).\nIf you meet the eligibility requirements in the <strong>Nonprofit Certification Policy<\/strong> and are either a “Public Charity” under Section 509(a) of the Code or a \"Private Operating Foundation\" under IRS regulations, you may be automatically enrolled with PayPal Giving Fund upon acceptance of this user agreement.\nYou will receive an email from us confirming your enrollment.\nYour relationship with PayPal Giving Fund will be governed by the <strong>Nonprofit User Agreement<\/strong>, including receiving email communications from PayPal Giving Fund about its current and future partners about its programs.\nYou can opt out of email communications at any time in your <strong>PayPal Giving Fund profile<\/strong>.\nIf you don’t want to be enrolled or receive donations from PayPal Giving Fund, you can opt-out at any time by <strong>contacting us<\/strong>.\nFor more information, please see <strong>PayPal Giving Fund’s Policies<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a “card not present” transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Accepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer’s account through preauthorized transfers either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a “billing agreement,” \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"<\/p> If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers: <p>You must:<\/p>\n<p>You must not:<\/p>\n<p>Get each buyer’s prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.<\/p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer’s written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.<\/p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancelation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.<\/p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.<\/p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer’s option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.<\/p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the country of the buyer’s account or the currency of their card;<\/li>\n<li>whether you are registered as a charitable organization and have active 501(c)(3) status.\nYour 501(c)(3) status must be documented with PayPal to receive the rates applicable to charitable organizations, and those rates will apply only after you document your status with us.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Standard transaction fees <p>The fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Standard Transaction Fees table, with the fees applicable to charitable organizations founds on the Standard Transaction Fees for Charitable Organizations table for the charitable fees.\nPlease note that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 21 days’ advance notice for personal PayPal accounts and at least 5 days’ advance notice for business PayPal accounts of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.<\/li>\n<li>If you refund a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned.<\/li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Here or PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Micropayments fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the Micropayment Fees table will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of Standard Transaction Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal’s Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nYou may be able to choose to send payments to PayPal accounts, Venmo accounts, or both.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a business PayPal account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand<\/li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.<\/p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay service, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.<\/p>\n<p>You can send money through Payouts or Mass Pay even if your receiver does not have a PayPal or Venmo account, as applicable, using their email address or mobile number.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a relevant account, they can claim it by opening one.\nIf they don’t claim it, it will be refunded to you in thirty (30) days.\nPayPal is not liable for amounts sent by you in error.\nPayPal shall have no responsibility to reverse any payout payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Your responsibility to notify PayPal of pricing or fee errors <p>Once you have access to any account statement(s) or other account activity information made available to you by PayPal with respect to your business account(s), you will have ninety (90) days to notify PayPal in writing of any errors or discrepancies with respect to the pricing or other fees applied by PayPal.\nIf you do not notify PayPal within such timeframe, you accept such information as accurate, and PayPal shall have no obligation to make any corrections.\nFor the purposes of this provision, such pricing or fee errors or discrepancies are different than Unauthorized Transactions and other electronic transfer<strong> Errors<\/strong> which are each subject to different notification timeframes as set forth herein.<\/p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks <p>&nbsp;<\/p> General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account.\nIf a currency conversion is necessary (for example if the balance in your Cash Account or your business PayPal account for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, or if the buyer paid in a different currency), PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you refund a payment for goods or services, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned to you.\nThe amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Purchase Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.<\/li>\n<li>You lose a Venmo Protected Purchase Program claim.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.<\/li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven’t opted out).<\/li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer’s bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.<\/li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized<\/li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement or any other agreement between you and PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated or reversed for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of that payment may be calculated in that currency, using the PayPal transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) that applies at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account doesn’t cover the payment amount due plus the fees, we may use any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to cover the amount due.\nIf the payment methods linked to your PayPal account don’t cover the amount due, this will result in a negative balance.\nA negative balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your balance to resolve it.\nIf you don’t, PayPal may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover the amount due from you;<\/li>\n<li>take any or all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Dispute fees <p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> table, then the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> amount will be determined when the dispute case is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your dispute ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July, and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions<\/strong>.\nand all chargebacks from the buyer’s card issuer or reversals from the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>If your dispute ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.<\/p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s<strong> Resolution Center<\/strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal’s Seller Protection<\/strong> program.<\/li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a Standard Dispute fee.<\/li>\n<li>Decided in your favor by PayPal or your issuer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s<strong> Resolution Center<\/strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees<\/strong> may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.<\/p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Chargeback fees <p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, then PayPal will charge you a <strong>Chargeback fee<\/strong> for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee with apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.<\/p> The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee table and will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Chargeback fee<\/strong> table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal’s Purchase Protection program, Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program, and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection available to buyers in each of those countries.\nBuyers’ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about PayPal’s protection programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer’s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding user agreement.\nYou can find information on Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program in Venmo’s user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program in any country, or under Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay’s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What’s eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal’s Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal’s Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount for debit and credit card-funded transactions.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal’s Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an “Unauthorized Transaction” claim), and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by Paypal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They didn’t receive the item from you (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal’s Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal’s Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the United States.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for items subject to the Intangible Goods Additional Requirements.\nTransactions involving items that you deliver in person in connection with payment made in your physical store, may also be eligible for Seller Protection so long as the buyer paid for the transaction in person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.\n<ul>\n<li>The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person.\nprovided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Center.\nIf you do not respond to PayPal’s request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>Provide proof of shipment or delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The payment must be marked “eligible” or “partially eligible” in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims, for PayPal's Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Seller Protection program.\nPayPal will make a decision, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements, any information or documentation provided during the resolution process, or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Item Not Received additional requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection program for a buyer’s Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked “eligible” for PayPal’s Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, the sale must meet the <strong>basic requirements<\/strong> and the following additional requirements: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements<\/li>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third party or if you have a native app integration.<\/li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.<\/li>\n<li>Paid <strong>Standard Transaction Fees<\/strong> on the sale.<\/li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide <strong>Proof of shipment or delivery for Intangible Goods<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Provide signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount listed in the <strong>signature confirmation threshold table<\/strong> (based on the currency of the payment).\nIf the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods: <p>Proof of shipment<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery<\/p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that

requirements.\nPlease ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide ‘delivered’ status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for intangible goods: <p>\n<strong>QR Code Transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p> The following is required as proof of shipment or proof of delivery: <p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.\nCompelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Received or accessed by the recipient.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For QR code transactions, you may be required to provide

estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.\nPayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we close your PayPal account or terminate your use of the PayPal services for any reason, we’ll provide you with notice of our actions and make any unrestricted funds held in the balance of your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account or in the balance of your business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed

network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nUnless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we’ll provide you with notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these actions.\nTo request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Center or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.<\/p>\n<p>In order to facilitate PayPal’s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal’s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.<\/li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.<\/li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on PayPal’s risk decisions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe’ll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.<\/p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 21 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you’ve uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 21 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we’ll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved (but no longer than 180 days).<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds related to Marketplace transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third party directly.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on disputed transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we’ll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we’ll remove the funds from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we’ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.<\/li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you’ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Reserves placed on business PayPal accounts <p>We may place a reserve on your business PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your business PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your business PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the money in your business PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your business PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your business PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve<\/strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve<\/strong> is a specific minimum amount of money that you’re required to keep available in the balance of your business PayPal account at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, the funds will be shown as \"pending\" and we’ll notify you of the terms of the reserve.<br> If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you of the new terms.<br>\n<\/p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place longer than 180 days.<\/p> PayPal User Agreement Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is an Unauthorized Transaction <p>An “Unauthorized Transaction” occurs when money is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction <p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Reporting an Unauthorized Transaction <p>If you believe your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen, please contact PayPal customer service immediately or call: (888) 221-1161 or write: PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.<\/p>\n<p>Tell us AT ONCE if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using your login information or by other means.\nYou could lose all the money in your PayPal account.\nIf you tell us within 60 days after we provide you your PayPal account statement showing transfers you did not make, you will be eligible for 100% protection for Unauthorized Transactions.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if your PayPal account statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made with your PayPal login information or by other means, tell us at once.\nIf you do not tell us within 60 days after we provided the statement to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.\nIf a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods.<\/p> Error Resolution <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is an Error <p>An “Error” means the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When money is either incorrectly taken from your PayPal account or incorrectly placed into your PayPal account, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>An incorrect amount is credited to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.<\/li>\n<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You request receipt or periodic statement documents that PayPal is required to provide to you.<\/li>\n<li>You request information concerning preauthorized (recurring) transfers to your PayPal account that PayPal is required to provide to you.<\/li>\n<li>You request additional information or clarification concerning a transfer to or from your PayPal account, including a request you make to determine whether an error has occurred.<\/li>\n<li>You inquire about the status of a pending transfer to or from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You request documentation or other information, unless the request is for a duplicate copy for tax or other record-keeping purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered an Error <p>The following are NOT considered Errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Routine inquiries about the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Requests for duplicate documentation or other information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> In case of Errors or questions about your electronic transfers <p>Telephone us at (888) 221-1161, contact us through the PayPal Resolution Center.\nor write us at PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.\n<\/p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name and account number (if any).<\/li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.<\/li>\n<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.<\/p>\n<p>We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly.\nIf we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, we will credit your PayPal account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nFor new PayPal accounts, we may take up to 20 Business Days to credit your PayPal account for the amount you think is in error.<\/p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.<\/p> Processing Errors <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover.\nIf the error results in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You receiving less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.<\/li>\n<li>You receiving more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.<\/li>\n<li>Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: <ul>\n<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;<\/li>\n<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/li>\n<li>the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Processing errors are not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.<\/li>\n<li>Delays based on a payment review.<\/li>\n<li>Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.<\/li>\n<li>Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount of money that you are sending).<\/li>\n<\/ul> Remittance Transfer Errors <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is a Remittance Transfer <p>You may be protected for certain errors when you send money using a PayPal account outside of the U.S.\nA “Remittance Transfer” is a transaction that meets the following criteria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The payment is sent from a personal PayPal account that is used primarily for personal, family or household purposes,<\/li>\n<li>The payment is made for personal, family or household purposes,<\/li>\n<li>The payment is made using the send money feature through your PayPal account,<\/li>\n<li>The payment amount equals or exceeds $15 USD (excluding fees charged to you) or the foreign currency equivalent calculated using exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction, and<\/li>\n<li>The recipient of the payment has a PayPal account in a country outside the U.S.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Payments that you make at a merchant website or location by selecting PayPal as a payment option are not “Remittance Transfers.”<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What qualifies as a Remittance Transfer Error <p>A <strong>“Remittance Transfer Error”<\/strong> occurs if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You paid an incorrect amount to send the Remittance Transfer.\nFor example, you were charged more than the total shown on the remittance transfer receipt you received (unless the total shown on the receipt was an estimate, and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes).<\/li>\n<li>PayPal made a computational or bookkeeping error, such as a miscalculation of the amount the recipient received.<\/li>\n<li>The amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt was not made available to the recipient, unless: <ul>\n<li>we stated in the remittance transfer receipt that we used estimates and the difference in the amount received and the amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, or<\/li>\n<li>the problem was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside our control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Funds were available to the recipient later than the date of availability that was disclosed to you on the remittance transfer receipt or were not delivered, unless: <ul>\n<li>extraordinary circumstances outside our control caused the delay, and we could not reasonably anticipate those circumstances,<\/li>\n<li>delays resulted from fraud screenings, or were caused by requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Controls or similar requirements, or<\/li>\n<li>you (or someone assisting you) made the transfer with fraudulent intent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>You request documentation or information concerning the Remittance Transfer, such as information required to determine if a Remittance Transfer Error occurred.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered a Remittance Transfer Error <p>The following are NOT considered Remittance Transfer Errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An inquiry about the status of a Remittance Transfer, except where the funds from the transfer were not made available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability,<\/li>\n<li>A request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes,<\/li>\n<li>A change requested by the designated recipient, or<\/li>\n<li>A change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the amount or type of currency stated in the disclosure provided you, if we relied on information provided by you in making the disclosure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What to do if you think there has

one PayPal account, we may set off a negative balance in one PayPal account against a balance in your other PayPal account(s), including a Cash Account.\nIf you continue using your PayPal account when it has a negative balance, you authorize PayPal to combine the negative balance with any debit or transaction sent from your account when that combination is disclosed to you in advance of initiating the debit or transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold funds in a PayPal account in multiple currencies, and the balance for one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, PayPal may set off the negative balance by using funds you maintain in a different currency.\nIf you have a negative balance in non-U.S.\ndollars for a period of 21 days or longer, PayPal will convert this negative balance to U.S.\ndollars.\nIn either case, a currency conversion will be necessary, and PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the above, if you have a past due amount owed to us, our affiliates, or eBay, PayPal may debit your PayPal account to pay any amounts that are past due.\nThis includes amounts owed by using our various

to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and check issuances are processed in a timely manner but PayPal makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the PayPal services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or the U.S.\nor international mail service.\nSome states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Release of PayPal <p>If you

days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If a dispute arises between you and PayPal, acting as either a buyer or a seller, our goal is to learn about

arise between you and PayPal, including without limitation federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\nThis Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em> Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and PayPal agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.\nUnless both you and PayPal agree otherwise, the arbitrator(s) may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding.\nAlso, the arbitrator(s) may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s).\nAny relief awarded cannot affect other PayPal customers.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Arbitration Procedures<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.\nHowever, the arbitrator(s) can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.\nThe arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of this user agreement as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator(s) to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (referred to as the \"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other party, by certified mail, a completed Notice of Dispute.\nYou should send this notice to PayPal at: PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.\nPayPal will send any notice to you to the address we have on file associated with your PayPal account.\nit is your responsibility to keep your address up to date.\nAll information called for in the notice must be provided including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.<\/p>\n<p>If you and PayPal are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, you or PayPal may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nA form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at www.adr.org.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or PayPal may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and PayPal subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.\nIn cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or PayPal may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator(s) require otherwise.\nAny settlement offer made by you or PayPal shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator(s).<\/p>\n<p>The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PayPal customers, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PayPal customer to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Costs of Arbitration<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, PayPal will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.\nAny request for payment of fees by PayPal should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and PayPal will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, PayPal will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator(s) deem necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive.\nIn the event the arbitrator(s) determine the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse PayPal for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by PayPal on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Severability<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\nIf a court decides that any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in court.\nAll other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall be arbitrated under its terms.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Opt-Out Procedure<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a new PayPal customer, you can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice.\nThe opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time.\nYou must mail the opt-out notice to PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.<\/p>\n<p>For your convenience, we are providing an opt-out notice form you must complete and mail to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nYou must complete this form by providing all the information it calls for, including your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the PayPal account(s) to which the opt-out applies.\nYou must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective.\nThis procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the user agreement will continue to apply.\nOpting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.<\/p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Future

extent and for the time we reasonably require to protect us and/or any third party against the risk of reversals, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities of whatever nature.\nAfter this time you will be able to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.\nPlease Contact Us if you have any questions about funds held in your account on closure.<br>\n<strong>If you are the legal representative of an incapacitated or deceased account holder, please Contact Us for assistance.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the event that we decide to discontinue any of our services or any portion or feature of our services for any reason, we will give you at least two months prior notice before discontinuing the service or feature, unless we determine in good faith that: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the service or feature must be discontinued sooner as required by law or a third-party relationship.\nor <\/li>\n<li>doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Linking and Unlinking a Funding Source <p>All money in your account is legally termed “electronic money”, which is recognised throughout the European Economic Area as a form of money suitable for use online.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can use a funding source as a way to pay us to obtain electronic money in your account or to receive withdrawals from your account, as further outlined in this user agreement (see in particular Adding or Withdrawing Money and Funding your Payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card, a prepaid card (where available) a bank account or PayPal Credit (where available) to your PayPal account as a funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may limit the availability of your funding sources to manage our risk.<\/p>\n<p>Please keep your funding source information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third-party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may contact your issuer to request this or remove your funding source from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your funding source, we will keep any preference setting attached to that funding source.\nYou may choose to confirm your card or bank account, so that we can verify that the card or bank account is valid and that you are its owner.\nWe may allow you to do this by following the Link and Confirm Card process (for cards) or the Bank Confirmation process (for bank accounts) or other processes which we may notify to you or which we may publish from time to time.<\/p>Your continuous permission for us to charge your funding sources <p>By linking a funding source to your PayPal account, you give us continuous permission to automatically charge that funding source (subject to this user agreement and the terms of any mandate (e.g.\nbank direct debit) used by the provider of that funding source to set up and maintain that authority) for the required value of the electronic money:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>to cover the payment amount (plus all transaction fees payable to us) when you use your account to send a payment to another user.\nand<\/li>\n<li>to top up your account when you use the Add Funds functionality account interface.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may charge the funding source again if the previous attempt failed.\nIf you cancel any continuous permission from your funding source, you will reimburse us for the value of any electronic money we’ve already issued for which a charge from that funding source remains outstanding.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can stop the permission by unlinking the funding source from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>SEPA is an initiative of the European Commission and European banking sector, aimed at making transactions more efficient within the European Union.\nWhenever you register a bank account with PayPal or use a new bank account for the first time as a Funding Source, you grant PayPal a SEPA Direct Debit mandate.\nIf you use a SEPA Direct Debit mandate for the continuous authority:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can access the mandate and the mandate reference number (MRN) in your PayPal account profile at any time and cancel or change the mandate for future transactions.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal will inform you of the amount of the SEPA Direct Debit payment and the time frame in which PayPal will collect the amount from the bank account together with the purchase confirmation.\nIf PayPal resubmits any SEPA Direct Debit payment request due to reversal of the original payment, there will be no (additional) information given on the amount and the time frame ahead of the resubmission.<\/li>\n<li>you can claim a refund from your bank at any time up to 8 weeks after the date on which the SEPA Direct Debit payment took place in accordance with your bank’s terms and conditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Risk of reversals to your funding source and when eCheques may arise <p>When we receive a payment from your funding source we may store the resulting electronic money in your reserve account for as long as we have reason to believe that there is risk of reversal by the funding source provider.\nThis is because we do not have all the information necessary to place the funds from your payment at your disposal in your PayPal balance while there is such a risk of reversal.\n<\/p>\n<p>When you instruct us to make a payment from your account to another user funded by a payment from your bank account and we store the resulting electronic money in this way, we call this type of payment from your bank account an “eCheque” payment.\nSee Funding payments you send from your account below for how we use eCheques.<\/p> Holding and using a PayPal balance <p>You will not receive interest or any other earnings on the money in your account.\nThis is because the money in your account is electronic money and European law forbids paying interest on electronic money.\nAlso, electronic money is not a deposit or an investment under Luxembourg law, so the Luxembourg deposit guarantee or investor indemnity schemes administered by the <i>Conseil des Protection des Deposants et des Investisseurs<\/i> cannot protect you.<\/p>\n<p>We may store and move the money in your account in and between:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the PayPal balance.\nand <\/li>\n<li>the reserve account, <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>at any given time subject further to this user agreement.<\/p>PayPal balance <p>The operational part of your account contains your PayPal balance, which is the balance of money available for payments or withdrawals.\n<\/p>\n<p>When you use our payment service to pay another user, you instruct us to transfer the money from your PayPal balance to the recipient’s account.\n<\/p>\n<p>You need to have enough PayPal balance in cleared funds to cover the amount of any payment you make and the transaction fees you owe us at the time of the payment.\nOther requirements also apply – see the section Making a Payment below.\nIf you have insufficient PayPal balance or have chosen a preferred funding source you are also requesting us to obtain funds on your behalf from your applicable funding source and issue electronic money to your PayPal balance for your payment to be made.<\/p>\n<p>When you withdraw your money you need to have enough PayPal balance to cover the value of any withdrawal at the time of the withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>See Adding or Withdrawing Money to know how to get a PayPal balance and how to withdraw it.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal balance shows a negative amount, this is the net amount you owe to us at the given time.\n<\/p> Reserve account <p>Money marked in your account overview as “pending”, “uncleared”, “held” or otherwise restricted or limited at any given time is held in the part of your account which acts as a reserve account.\nYou cannot access and use money stored in the reserve account.<\/p> Adding or Withdrawing Money Adding money <p>To get electronic money into your account you can, subject further to this user agreement:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>accept a payment in your account from someone else.\nWe may charge you fees for this.\nor<\/li>\n<li>obtain electronic money from us by paying us an equivalent amount.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can obtain electronic money from us by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>automatically using your applicable funding source(s) to cover the amount of the payments that you instruct us to send to other users (and the transaction fees payable by you to us)..\nor<\/li>\n<li>manually using the “Add Funds” function available from your account interface to pay us or instructing us to charge your funding source for the electronic money.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The execution of any payment to us from your funding source provider is your funding source provider’s legal responsibility.\nWe have no control over how long the payment to us will take.<\/p>Withdrawing money <p>If you have a PayPal balance, you may withdraw any amount by transferring it to your nominated funding source linked to your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nThis could include your bank account or debit or credit card, depending on the country in which your PayPal account is registered.<\/p>\n<p>When you instruct us to withdraw any amount of your PayPal balance, subject further to this user agreement we will:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>convert the electronic money to money that we can transfer to your nominated funding source.\nand <\/li>\n<li>instruct our own bank to transfer that money to your nominated funding source.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We aim to send the withdrawal payment instruction to our bank by the end of the next Business Day (“Business Day” means a day on which banks in Luxembourg are open to the general public).\nif there are no other delays subject to this user agreement.\nOnce our bank receives our payment instruction, we have no control over how long the payment to you will take to complete.\nAt this point, our bank, your funding source provider and the payment systems that they rely on take over responsibility for getting the money to your nominated funding source and this can affect the time it takes for you to receive your money.\nWe may allow you to withdraw the money by transferring the money to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an eligible bank account (where we make this available) through: <ul>\n<li>a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your account (this withdrawal/redemption functionality is sometimes known as “transfer to bank”).\nor<\/li>\n<li>an Instant Transfer to your bank account linked to your account.\n<br>\n<br> We may allow the above transfers to be made through the debit card attached to that bank account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>your branded MasterCard or Visa card (where we make this available).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Fees apply to withdrawals.\nWe will also disclose to you the fees in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>The funding source (for example, bank account or card) into which you request the withdrawal must be denominated in the original opening currency of your account or another currency that PayPal supports for withdrawals in your country of residence.<\/p>\n<p>You may only withdraw PayPal balance in the opening currency of your account, unless we agree otherwise.\nIn order to withdraw PayPal balance held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nOur transaction exchange rate will be used.<\/p>\n<p>This means that if you withdraw:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal balance held in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into your original opening currency.\nand<\/li>\n<li>to a funding source (for example, bank account or card) denominated in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into the currency in which the funding source is denominated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To protect you, our other users and us from loss and to allow us to comply with our anti-money laundering and other legal obligations, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorised the withdrawal or if payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview) to lift your withdrawal limit.<\/p> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies <p>When you open your account, it is configured for use with the opening currency of your account.\n<\/p>\n<p>The opening currency of your account is Euro (EUR).\n<\/p>\n<p>We may configure your account further so that you can use it to store money and send and receive payments in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nIf you hold a PayPal balance, we may allow you to convert it to balance in another currency.\n<\/p>\n<p> If your PayPal balance is not enough to cover the amount of a payment you instruct us to make in a particular currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall.\nThere may be some restrictions on where you can send payments in certain currencies.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may allow you to choose the way in which your account treats and/or converts payments received in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nTo receive money in a currency other than the opening currency of your account, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n<\/p>\n<p> Payments in certain currencies can only be received by automatic conversion of the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you receive a payment from anyone who doesn’t have a PayPal account and that payment is in a currency which your account is not currently configured to use, we may automatically convert the amount received into a currency that your account is configured to use at the time the payment is made.\n<\/p>\n<p> Please see the Withdrawing Money section above to see how withdrawals in different currencies can be made.\n<\/p>\n<p> If one of the currency balances in your account shows that you owe us an amount of funds for any reason, we may set off the amount you owe us by using funds you maintain in a different currency balance or by deducting amounts you owe us from money you receive into your account, or money you attempt to withdraw or send from your account, or in a different account, and by deducting funds from any withdrawals you attempt to make.\nIf, for a period of 21 Days, you have a PayPal balance that reflects an amount owing to us that is not in Euros, we may convert the amount you owe us to Euros.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.\nYou are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that we determine is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nWe may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.\n<\/p>How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\n<\/p>\n<p> The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).\n<\/p>\n<p> We may make a transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) available for your review during your transaction.\nIf you complete the transaction, that transaction exchange rate may apply to the payment for the transaction whenever it is processed.\nor that rate may be valid only if the payment for that transaction is processed within a limited time, as stated during the transaction.\nAfter that limited time, we may use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the transaction is processed, or not perform the currency conversion.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you have authorised a payment under a billing agreement, and we perform currency conversion for that payment, we will use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the payment transaction is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment under a billing agreement may vary.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may provide you access to a “Currency Converter” tool to see what transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) may apply for certain currency conversions.\nAny rates shown using the Currency Converter tool only apply at the time you use the tool and are subject to change.<\/p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorise us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\n<\/p>\n<p> You may have the right to have your card issuer convert the currency of the card payment into the currency in which you send the payment from your PayPal account, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether we or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.\n<\/p>\n<p> PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use existing balance or your linked bank account is the funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p> If PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup funding source to be chosen, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on the payment from your backup funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p> Where a currency conversion is offered at the point of sale by the merchant, not by PayPal, and you choose to authorise the payment transaction on the basis of the merchant's exchange rate and charges, PayPal has no liability to you for that currency conversion.\n<\/p> Account Statements and Requesting Account Records <p>Unless your Account is restricted you may view and download your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou agree to review your transactions through your PayPal account history instead of receiving periodic statements by email.\n<\/p>\n<p>Key information relating to your payments will be provided to you via e-mail and your transaction history will also be updated and made available to you at any time by logging into your account.\nYou can also access a downloadable report from your PayPal account.\nThis will show all fees incurred and any other amounts charged to your PayPal account in the relevant period.\nThe report will only be updated and made available if there has been any activity on your PayPal account or any fees have been incurred in the relevant period.\nThe way in which we provide the transaction information will allow you to store and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy.\n<\/p>\n<p> We reserve the right to charge a fee for providing you with additional information or for providing the transaction history and other information about fees in a different way but we won’t charge you for records requested in connection with your good-faith assertion of an error in your PayPal account.<\/p> Fees <p> We charge fees for our services as set out on the fees page.\n<\/p>\n<p> Quoted fees are inclusive of all applicable taxes.\nhowever, other taxes or costs may exist that are not paid through or imposed by us.\n<\/p>\n<p> You are liable for telephone charges and any charges made by your internet service provider or similar or associated charges as a result of the use by you of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may deduct our fees from your PayPal balance.\nWe may deduct our transaction-related fees from the amounts we transfer before those funds are credited to your PayPal balance.\n<\/p>\n<p> We will provide you with the details of the amounts you receive and our fees charged either by e-mail or in your transaction history (which you can access by logging into your account).\n<\/p>\n<p> If your payment requires you to pay a fee to us, we may disclose that fee to you when you provide your payment instruction to us.\n<\/p>\n<p> You cannot set off or deduct any amounts from our fees.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may make a charge for any additional services we provide outside this user agreement.\nWe will tell you of those charges when you ask for the service.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a merchant and you wish to apply for (and retain) our volume-based tiered merchant rate, the terms of the merchant rate in the Receiving Payments section below apply.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nMaking A Payment General provisions for making a payment Your payment instruction <p>We may allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in any way which we may notify to you from time to time.\nThe way in which you provide your payment instruction can depend on the type of payment you are making – for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are paying for a purchase or making a donation, many sellers and/or fund collectors allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in a dedicated PayPal checkout or other PayPal payment collection integration on their site.<\/li>\n<li>You can use the “Send Money” feature when you log into your PayPal account to send a payment to someone.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> We may require you to authenticate your instruction (i.e.\ngive us the information that we need to be sure that it’s you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information – this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your payment instruction.\n<\/p> Cancelling your payment instruction <p> Once you provide you payment instruction to us, you may not cancel it, except if it is a payment instruction under a billing agreement (see below for more details).\n<\/p> How long will my payment take? <p>Your payment to another user will leave your account [within the Business Day] after we receive your complete payment instruction.<\/p>\n<p>The payment will leave your account within two Business Days if we receive your complete payment instruction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>on a day which is not a Business Day.\nor<\/li>\n<li>after the following local cut off times on a Business Day for accounts registered in the following countries: 4pm in Netherlands.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may allow you to ask us to make your payment on a specific later date, in which case your payment will leave your account on that later date.<\/p>\n<p>Other provisions in this user agreement may cause the above timeframes to be extended.<\/p>When we may refuse to make your payment <p>We may treat your payment instruction as not complete and we may refuse to make your payment if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you do not have enough money in your PayPal balance.\n<\/li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that your linked funding sources do not have sufficient funds to cover the money required to make your payment;<\/li>\n<li>you do not provide us with all mandatory information requested in the relevant payment or checkout flows which we use to obtain your payment instructions (for instance, sufficient details of the recipient as we may request and authentication of your payment instruction);<\/li>\n<li>the payment exceeds the sending limit we tell you about when you try to make the payment.\nor<\/li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that a restricted activity has happened in relation to your account or you are otherwise in breach of this user agreement.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> When your payment is not accepted by the recipient <p> If we allow you to send a payment to someone who does not have a PayPal account, the recipient can claim the money by opening a PayPal account.\n<\/p>\n<p> If the recipient already has a PayPal account, they can refuse to accept the money.\n<\/p>\n<p> If the recipient refuses to accept the money or doesn’t open a PayPal account and claim the money within 30 days after the date it is sent, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to your PayPal account.\nSee Refunds to your account for what can happen when your PayPal account receives a refund.\n<\/p> Sending limits <p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can make, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nTo lift your sending limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).<\/p> Setting up automatic charges from your account Seller delayed payments <p> When you pay certain sellers or pay for certain purchases (for instance, purchases which have to be shipped to you or may be updated and finalised by the seller), you are providing: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an authorisation to the seller to collect your payment at a later time.\nand<\/li>\n<li>an instruction to us to automatically pay that seller when the seller requests payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> Your authorisation will typically remain valid for up to 30 days, but may remain valid for longer.\nIf you have balance, we may hold the payment amount as pending until the seller collects your payment.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied (as described in the Currency Conversion section) at the time the payment is processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> Your authorisation allows the seller to update the payment amount before the seller collects the payment (to account for any changes to the purchase that you may agree with the seller, such as additional taxes, shipping or postage charges or discounts).\nWe are not required to verify any changes at any time (including at the time the payment is transferred).\nWe may transfer any amount on the basis of your authorisation and upon receiving instructions from the seller of the final payment amount.\n<\/p> Billing agreement payments <p> You can use a billing agreement to manage payments to the same recipient(s) on an ongoing automatic basis.\nWhen you enter into a billing agreement:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>you authorise the named recipient(s) to collect payments from your account as the recipient determines (this could be for payments of amounts you owe the recipient for a purchase of goods or services under a separate contract that you have with the recipient).\nand<\/li>\n<li>you instruct PayPal to pay the named recipient(s) (or other recipient(s) that the named recipient(s) direct(s)) when the named recipient(s) request(s) PayPal to make your payment.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This makes the recipient a “trusted beneficiary” (the legal term for someone you tell us is a trusted recipient) of all your payments made under that billing agreement, so we will not normally ask you to authenticate (e.g.\nlog in) or approve these payments when they are made.\n<\/p>\n<p> Payments made under the billing agreement may be in variable amounts and may be made on various dates.\nWe are only a payment service provider so we can’t (and please don’t expect us to) know what you have or haven’t agreed with the recipient or to know why the recipient decided to collect your payment.\nWe are not obliged to verify or confirm the amount the recipient presents to us for the purpose of processing payments made under the billing agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> We use several names for payments that can be managed by a billing agreement – these include “automatic payments,” \"subscription payments\" \"recurring payments” “reference transactions” \"preauthorised transfers\" or \"preapproved payment.\" <\/p>\n<p> You can cancel your billing agreement at any time with immediate effect in your account interface or by contacting us.\nWhere a payment under that billing agreement is scheduled to be made before the end of the next Business Day after you tell us to cancel it, we may cancel your billing agreement after that payment has been made.\nIf you cancel a billing agreement, you may still owe the recipient money for goods or services that you have received but have not paid for.\n<\/p>\n<p> If we determine currency conversion is necessary for a billing agreement payment, and we perform the conversion, we will use the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the payment is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment transaction may vary.\n<\/p> Refunds to your account How refunds can happen <p> We may allow the recipient of your payment to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>refuse to accept it.\nor<\/li>\n<li>decide to accept it and then use our service to send you a refund of all or any part of the amount of the payment later.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> We will return the amount of any refused payment or refunded payment to your Balance.\nWe will return the amount of an unclaimed payment to your balance within 30 days after the date you initiated the payment.\nIf any amount of any payment is returned to you in any of the ways outlined above, we may convert the returned amount for you into either: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the currency of the balance you used for the original payment (before any conversion into the currency received by the recipient happened);<\/li>\n<li>the opening currency of your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>US dollars (opening a balance in that currency for you, if you don’t have one already).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the original payment you sent involved a currency conversion we will convert the returned amount from the currency received by the recipient as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the amount is returned within 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable on the date of the original payment, so that you receive the original amount (including the currency conversion fee you paid) in the original currency you converted for the original payment.\nand<\/li>\n<li>if the amount is returned after 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of the conversion of the returned amount.\nYou agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Unless otherwise outlined above in this section, you agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments when you convert any amount returned to you in the ways outlined above.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may also automatically withdraw the returned amount from your Balance and transfer the funds back to the funding source you used for the original payment.\nWithdrawals can also involve a currency conversion – see the section on Withdrawing money above.\n<\/p>Risks when receiving refunds <p> The returned amount could be lower in value than your original payment amount.\nThis can happen as a result of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the recipient sending you a refund lower in value than your original payment amount.\nAs we are only a payment service provider, we cannot know what you are entitled to from the original payment recipient as a refund or why the recipient sent the refund in a particular amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>transaction exchange rate fluctuations.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal is not responsible for any loss resulting from the recipient's decision to refuse or refund your payment, except to the extent that a refund sent by the recipient is a payment executed incorrectly by PayPal <\/p>\n<p>We are not liable to you for the difference between the value of your original payment and the value of the resulting refund, except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).\n<\/p> Funding Your Payment Selecting a preferred funding source <p>You may select a preferred funding source when logged into your account.\nSubject to this user agreement, the preferred funding source will be used as the default funding source for payments you send from your account.<\/p>\n<p> You can set separate preferred funding sources for some billing agreement payments.\n<\/p> Special Funding Arrangements <p> Some payments can be funded by special funding arrangements linked to your PayPal account, such as merchant/transaction specific balance, gift vouchers or other promotional funding arrangements.\nThe use and priority of these special funding arrangements are subject to further terms and conditions between you and us.\nYour account overview may show the notional amount available in your special funding arrangements to fund qualifying payments at any given time.\nThis amount does not constitute electronic money, is not deemed part of your PayPal balance and is not redeemable in cash - it only represents the amount of electronic money which we offer to issue and credit to your account at the time of (and only to immediately fund) a qualifying payment, subject to (and only for the period outlined in) the further terms and conditions of use of that special funding arrangement.\nIf your payment funded by a special funding arrangement is reversed at a later time for any reason, we will keep the amount that represents the portion of that payment that was funded by your special funding arrangement and (provided that the special funding arrangement has not already expired) reinstate the special funding arrangement.<\/p> Funding payments you send from your account <p> We will obtain electronic money for the payment you send from your account from the following sources in the following order to the extent they are available:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Special Funding Arrangements (if available for the given transaction)<\/li>\n<li>Preferred funding source (if selected and available)<\/li>\n<li>Pre-existing PayPal balance<\/li>\n<li>Bank account (instant transfer via bank mandate)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal Credit (where available)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal-branded debit card (where available)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal-branded credit card (where available)<\/li>\n<li>Debit card<\/li>\n<li>Credit card<\/li>\n<li>Bank account (eCheque) <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you have linked a bank account as a funding source we may choose to offer you access to Pay After Delivery, which allows you to defer a charge to this bank account for a period of time.\nIf you are offered and choose to use this service, the Pay After Delivery Terms will apply.<\/p> PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection.\nWhen applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection.\nPayPal’s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn’t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn’t what you ordered (referred to as a “Significantly Not as Described” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the PayPal Buyer Protection, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.<\/p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection.<\/p>Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>\n<strong>will not<\/strong>\n<\/em> qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not Received claim, if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller’s retail point of sale, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions or<\/li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller’s description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as “new” but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn’t receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as “used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal Buyer Protection <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats, except for personally portable light vehicles used for recreational purposes like bicycles and wheeled hoverboards.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms, as well as payments made on crowdlending platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller’s retail point of sale, , except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Payments to state-run bodies, (except for state-owned enterprises) or traders acting on mandates received from state-run bodies.<\/li>\n<li>Payment equivalent to cash, including stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal Payments.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay&nbsp.\ni.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made in respect of gold (whether in physical form or in exchange-traded form).<\/li>\n<\/ul> Transaction eligibility for PayPal Buyer Protection <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, then follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery related to such purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you’re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the&nbsp;<strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>&nbsp;to pursue a claim under our PayPal Buyer Protection.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within&nbsp;180 days&nbsp;of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal&nbsp;account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days&nbsp;after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nIf you are making an Item Not Received claim, PayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.<\/p>\n<p>Step 3:&nbsp;<strong>Respond to PayPal’s requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4:&nbsp;<strong>Comply with PayPal’s shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you’re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item&nbsp;back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide Proof of Delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Step 5:&nbsp;<strong>PayPal will make a final decision&nbsp;<\/strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p> Event tickets <p>In certain cases, if you purchase a ticket or pay for the right to attend an event from a payment recipient who is a UK registered PayPal account holder (“Event”), all monies paid by you may be held by PayPal on trust for you, so that the beneficial interest in such monies remains with you until the performance of the Event in question.<\/p>Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal’s Buyer Protection.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don’t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our PayPal Buyer Protection, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can’t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we’ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won’t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).<\/p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller’s return policy.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nReceiving Payments General provisions for receiving payments <p>PayPal may allow anybody (with or without an account) to make a payment resulting in the issuance or transfer of electronic money to your account.\n<\/p>\n<p>By integrating (including by having already integrated) into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>The receipt of a payment into your account does not equate to the receipt of cleared funds.\nA notification that a payment has been sent to you does not amount to a receipt of electronic money in your account unless you have accepted the payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may allow you to accept payments in any currency supported by our Service from time to time.\n<\/p>\n<p>Where you (instead of PayPal) offer the payer at the point of sale a currency conversion of an amount you receive through PayPal, you will inform the buyer of the exchange rate and any charges that will be applied to the payment transaction.\nPayPal has no liability to any buyer if you fail to inform the buyer of the exchange rate and charges.\nYou acknowledge that if you fail to disclose the exchange rate and charges to the buyer this may constitute a criminal offence by you.<\/p>\n<p>Any payment sent to you may be subject to a reversal, payment review, limitation, reserve or hold as allowed under this user agreement.\n<\/p>Receiving limits <p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can receive, including money you receive for purchases.\nTo lift your receiving limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).<\/p>\n<strong>New checkout solution included in the PayPal Commerce Platform<\/strong>\n<p>The PayPal Commerce Platform includes our new checkout solution.&nbsp.\nThe checkout solution consists of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>our dedicated bundled checkout capability in your online checkout/platform to enable a buyer with or without an account to send a payment to your account.\nand<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fraud Protection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may offer you all, any part or any combination of parts of the checkout solution.\nIf we offer you the checkout solution and you choose to use it, in addition to this user agreement, you agree to the following further terms relating to the following capabilities:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement<\/strong>, when you use our APM functionality as part of the checkout solution.\nand<\/li>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Online Card Payment Services Agreement<\/strong>, when you use: <ul>\n<li>our Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments as part of the checkout solution bundle.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Fraud Protection as part of the checkout solution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Our <strong>Fees<\/strong>&nbsp;for using the checkout solution apply.<\/p> Rules about surcharging <p>PayPal does not encourage surcharging because it is a commercial practice that can penalise the consumer and create unnecessary confusion, friction and abandonment at checkout.\n<\/p>\n<p>You may only surcharge for the use of our services in compliance with any law applicable to you and not in excess of the surcharges that you apply for the use of other payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>If you surcharge a buyer, you, and not we, will inform the buyer of the requested charge.\nWe are not liable to any buyer where you have failed to inform the buyer of any surcharge.\nYou acknowledge that you could be committing a criminal offence if you surcharge and/or fail to disclose any form of surcharge to a buyer.<\/p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal as a payment method or mark at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or substantially similar:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>logo placement,<\/li>\n<li>position within any point of sale,<\/li>\n<li>treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, or fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterise PayPal as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal.<\/p> Taxes and information reporting <p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nWe are not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.\nAs a bank service provider no sales tax applies to the PayPal services in the EU.<\/p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy.<\/p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace’s or the third party application’s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p>\n<p>We may allow you to authorise certain marketplaces to use your account to pay amounts you owe to the marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) arising from a claim under the terms of the marketplace’s own resolution process (“<strong>Marketplace Due Amounts<\/strong>”).\nIf you give such an authorisation and the marketplace notifies us of the claim, you instruct us to process payments of all and any Marketplace Due Amounts relating to that claim from your PayPal account to that marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) according to the marketplace’s instructions to us.\nWe may treat your instruction for the payment of any given Marketplace Due Amount as cancelled if we decide that the claim would have been determined in your favour had it been filed as a claim with us.\nYou can also cancel this instruction by contacting us.\nAll claims filed directly with the marketplace are governed by the marketplace’s own policy only.\nThe terms of the PayPal Seller Protection Programme do not cover you for claims filed by your buyers directly with the marketplace.<\/p> Accepting billing agreement payments <p>If we allow you to accept payments from a payer under a billing agreement, when you present to us a payment request under that billing agreement, you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>warrant to us that the amounts you present have been agreed and consented to by the payer whose account will be deducted (including changes to those amounts) and that you will give prior notice of the deduction to the payer.\nand<\/li>\n<li>agree that you will notify the payer at least 4 weeks in advance of the amount they will collect if that amount has increased in such a manner that the payer could not have reasonably expected to pay such an amount, taking into account the payer’s previous spending patterns and the circumstances of the payment and that you are liable to us for any refunds of that payment in accordance with the terms of this user agreement.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Refunds and reversals of payments <p>When you receive a payment, it could be refunded or reversed.\nWe may allow you to send to the payer a refund of the payment.\nWe may carry out a reversal of your payment in certain circumstances.\nSee the rest of this section for more details.<\/p>Refunds <p>You alone are (and PayPal is not) responsible for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>your legal and contractual obligations towards the payer for any amount you return to the payer.\nand<\/li>\n<li>any difference between the cost to the payer of making the original payment and the value of the amount returned to the payer (for instance, as a result of transaction exchange rate fluctuations) except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).<br>\n<br>See our fees for details of the fees you paid to us as the recipient of the original payment which we retain when you use the special commercial transaction refund functionality in your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nexcept to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).<\/li>\n<\/ul>Reversals <p>If you receive a payment in your account, you owe us the full amount of the payment and our losses arising from processing the payment.\nThis can include our liability (including any fees, charges and penalties) towards any third party (including the payer and the payer’s funding source provider).<\/p>\n<p>A reversal happens when we exercise our right to set off the above amounts from your account under the section Reimbursement for your liability in this user agreement.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount you owe us in that currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall and you will be charged for the currency conversion.\nThis means that, for example, if you are a seller, amounts of payments received in your account may be removed from your account after you have delivered any goods or services sold.<\/p>\n<p>A reversal can happen when:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we reimburse the payer in respect of a PayPal Buyer Protection claim the payer made against you.<\/li>\n<li>we compensate the payer or the payer’s funding source provider (or both) because we receive a claim from the payer or their funding source provider for the payment amount under the reversal process used by that funding source provider.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For instance:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the payer used a card to fund the payment to you the payer could pursue a “chargeback” with the card issuer.\nThe card issuer, not us, determines whether the payer is successful when they pursue a chargeback.\nYou can find out more about chargebacks by reviewing our Chargeback Guide, accessible via the PayPal Security Centre and the section called: “Selling Safely”.\nThe PayPal Security Centre is accessed via the PayPal website.\nWe charge you a fee for receiving a chargeback claim.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If the payer used a bank account to fund the payment the payer or the bank could pursue a bank reversal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The amount claimed may be greater than the original amount you received due to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the time of payment and the time of the claim.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we may have to compensate your payer when they claimed that there was a problem with their payment (including that their payment was unauthorised or incorrect or that their billing agreement payment was not expected) – see Resolving Problems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>we are entitled to carry out the reversal for any other reason under this user agreement, including the provision Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Impact of PayPal Buyer Protection on sellers <p> You should read our Buyer Protection Policy and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection made available by PayPal to buyers in each of those countries as buyers’ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about the PayPal Buyer Protection on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer’s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding PayPal Buyer Protection listed on that page or in the corresponding user agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under&nbsp;PayPal Buyer Protection&nbsp.\nin any country:<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back plus pay for return shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/p>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay’s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your cash account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nplace a&nbsp;hold&nbsp;on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor<\/p>\n<p>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/p> PayPal Seller Protection What’s eligible <p>If you have received more than €100,000 per month at least once over a consecutive period of 6 months on your PayPal Account and/or if you are applying surcharge for the use of PayPal (when the law applicable to you allows you to apply surcharge), you are not eligible for PayPal seller protection and this section applies to you unless otherwise agreed between you and PayPal.\nPayPal will review your eligibility for seller protection in October and April of each calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks,&nbsp;you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Seller Protection.\nWhen it applies, PayPal Seller Protection entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program<\/p>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an “Unauthorized Transaction” claim) and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They didn’t receive the item from you (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal Seller Protection as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various PayPal Buyer protection processes on sellers.<\/p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the Netherlands.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for items subject to the&nbsp;<strong>Intangible Goods Additional Requirements<\/strong>.\nTransactions involving items that you deliver in person in connection with payment made in your physical store, may also be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection so long as the buyer paid for the transaction in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person, provided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the&nbsp;<strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.&nbsp;If you do not respond to PayPal’s request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>Provide proof of shipment or delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The payment must be marked \"eligible\" or \"partially eligible\" in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims for PayPal Seller Protection on the \"Transaction Details\" page.<\/li>\n<li>You must accept a single payment from one PayPal Account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Seller Protection program.\nPayPal will make a decision, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements, any information or documentation provided during the resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>Item Not Received additional requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection program for a buyer’s Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements&nbsp.\nlisted above and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked “eligible” for PayPal’s Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements<\/li>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third party or if you have a native app integration.<\/li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.<\/li>\n<li>If the transaction is a payment for digital goods or licenses for digital content, you must have paid Standard Transaction Fees on the sale (this does not apply to payments for other Intangible Goods).<\/li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of delivery for Intangible Goods.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as:<\/p>\n<p>Proof of shipment<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery<\/p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the Transaction Details page, or<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date

customers and others at any time in our sole discretion.&nbsp.\nThe actions we may take include, but are not limited to, the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terminate this user agreement, limit your account, and/or close or suspend your account, immediately and without penalty to us;<\/li>\n<li>Refuse to provide the PayPal services to you in the future;<\/li>\n<li>At any time and without liability, suspend, limit or terminate your access to our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, your PayPal account or any of the PayPal services, including limiting your ability to pay or send money with any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account, restricting your ability to send money or make withdrawals;<\/li>\n<li>Hold your money to the extent and for so long as reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability.\nYou acknowledge that, as a non-exhaustive guide:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>PayPal’s risk of liability in respect of card-funded payments that you receive can last until the risk of a chargeback closing in favour of the payer/buyer (as determined by card scheme rules) has passed.\nThis depends on certain factors, including, without limitation: <ul>\n<li>a.\nThe type of goods or services for which you receive payment.\nor<\/li>\n<li>b.\nThe timeframe for delivery of the goods or performance of the services for which you receive payment (e.g.\nsales of event tickets months in advance of the event date can present a higher and more enduring risk of chargebacks than sales of most other items or services);<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>PayPal’s risk of liability in respect of a claim or dispute arising from a payment that you receive can last for the time that it takes for the parties to close the claim or dispute and all appeals associated with that claim or dispute in accordance with PayPal Buyer Protection<\/li>\n<li>PayPal’s risk of liability in respect of any event of insolvency that you suffer can last for as long as and to the extent that laws applicable to your insolvency restrict PayPal from taking legal action against you.\nand<\/li>\n<li>If you allow your PayPal account to have a balance reflecting an amount owing to PayPal, PayPal’s risk of liability can last for the time and to the extent that you owe that amount to PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Block your PayPal account and/or hold any funds in the reserve account (including, without limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by PayPal, where PayPal’s rights arise from your engagement in the restricted activity);<\/li>\n<li>Refuse any particular payment transaction at any time for any reason and will only be

violation of this policy,<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account primarily for the purposes of your trade, business, craft or profession and you violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal's damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>you acknowledge and agree that USD 2,500.00 (or the prevailing equivalent in the currency of the country in which you reside) per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is: <ul>\n<li>a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated;<\/li>\n<li>reasonable and proportionate in its application to the provision of the Services to you.\nand<\/li>\n<li>necessary, but no more than sufficient, to protect PayPal’s legitimate interest in your compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy.\nand<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please also see the section below on <u>Your liability<\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>Unless otherwise directed by us, you must not use or attempt to use your account while it is suspended or has been closed.\nYou must ensure that all agreements with sellers or other third parties that involve third party initiated payments (including billing agreement payments) set up from your account are cancelled immediately upon the termination, suspension or closure of your account.\nYou remain liable under this user agreement in respect of all charges and other amounts incurred through the use of your account at any time, irrespective of termination, suspension or closure.<\/p> Holds, Limitations, and Reserves What are holds, limitations and reserves? <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nIf we take any of the actions described here, we will normally notify you of our actions, but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example if you are in breach of this user agreement or we consider it advisable for security reasons), take any of these actions without prior notice to you.<\/p>\n<p>To request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that any funds held under this user agreement may be placed in your reserve account and that you will provide to us any information as we may reasonably request to allow us to determine whether the risk has passed.<\/p>Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.&nbsp.\nWhen PayPal places a hold on a payment amount, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\n&nbsp;PayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include where we have reason to believe that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transactions are higher risk, this can be where the transaction involves the sale of goods or services in a high risk category, or other facts known to us typically resulting in an increased number of chargebacks, other claims or disputes or to be often involved in fraud or illegal activity;<\/li>\n<li>There is a sudden and abnormal change in a PayPal account holder’s selling activity including an increase in the number of chargebacks, reversals, or buyer complaints received in relation to such PayPal account;<\/li>\n<li>Any PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities;<\/li>\n<li>A PayPal account involved in the transaction may have been compromised, or that stolen financial details (bank or credit card) are used for the payment, or otherwise a transaction has not been properly authorised;<\/li>\n<li>A user is trying to send or withdraw funds they received fraudulently;<\/li>\n<li>A user has not provided sufficient Information to us to enable us to verify their identity or the identity of their business and/or the user has a limited trading history with PayPal;<\/li>\n<li>A payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer files a chargeback, reversal or PayPal Buyer Protection claim on a payment you received.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer files a claim under a marketplace's resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of reversal of funds in your account to your funding source.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).<\/li>\n<\/ul>Payment review <p>When we identify a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nThis may be because we have the reasonable suspicion that the payer’s PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities or for other reasons as determined by us in our reasonable discretion.&nbsp.\nThis may include where there is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).<\/p>\n<p>If a payment is subject to payment review, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>execute the payment order initiated by the buyer;<\/li>\n<li>in our discretion, immediately upon such execution restrict the payer’s account;<\/li>\n<li>place a hold on the payment [in the payer’s account].\nand/or<\/li>\n<li>notify the recipient to delay the delivery of the purchase paid for by the payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If we don’t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\n<p>All payments that complete payment review are still subject to being reversed under the terms of this user agreement but will be Seller Protection eligible if they meet the Seller Protection requirements.\nPayPal will provide notices to you by email and/or in the transaction history tab of your PayPal account.\nA payment subject to payment review is a review of the payment only and is implemented to reduce the risk of PayPal users receiving high risk transactions.\nA payment subject to payment review is neither a review nor a representation by PayPal as to the commercial dealings, character or reputation of a party to the payment transaction and should not be considered as a lessening of the respect of any person.<\/p>Holds related to your instructions <p>Certain PayPal functionality may allow you (whether directly or via someone you permit to act on your behalf, like an online marketplace platform on which you transact as a seller) to instruct us to hold your funds (including the proceeds of payments you receive using PayPal) in your reserve account.<\/p>\n<p>In such a case we will show you the availability status of those funds in your balance – the status descriptions may differ according to the functionality you used to instruct us to place the hold.\nWe will release the hold on the funds according to the instruction that you (or the entity that you have permitted to act on your behalf) give to us, subject to the rest of this user agreement.<\/p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice&nbsp;<strong>restricted activities<\/strong>, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.&nbsp.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including where we have reason to believe that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, then we’ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>Someone has used your card or bank account without your permission, for example if your debit or credit card issuer or bank alerts us to this.<\/li>\n<li>You have breached this user agreement or violated the&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>Your performance as a seller indicate your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you’ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities&nbsp;above).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also limit your PayPal account in order to comply with applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>Reserves <p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.&nbsp.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the funds in your PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A “rolling reserve”<\/strong>&nbsp;is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A “minimum reserve”<\/strong>&nbsp;is a specific minimum amount of funds that you’re required to keep available in your balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your PayPal account, the money will be moved to your reserve account and shown as “pending” and we’ll notify you about it.<\/p>\n<p>If we change the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you about it as well.<\/p>\n<p>You will undertake, at your own expense, any further action required to establish a reserve or other form of security in a manner reasonably determined by us.&nbsp.\nThis can involve executing any necessary documents and registering any form of document reasonably required by us to allow us to perfect any form of security interest.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nRESOLVING PROBLEMS <strong>\n<p>We strongly recommend that you monitor your account closely on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<\/strong> If you find a problem… <p>If you have any reason to believe that there is a problem with your account or our service, follow these steps:<\/p> Step 1: Take a few moments to identify the type of problem: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Unexpected billing agreement payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where you entered into a billing agreement but a payment was sent from your account to another PayPal account under that billing agreement where:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you didn’t agree with the recipient in advance the exact payment amount.\nand<\/li>\n<li>the payment amount ended up being more than you could reasonably have expected to pay based on previous charges and the other circumstances.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Incorrect payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where a payment sent from your account to another PayPal account was not

problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that the payment was made because you did not keep your account safe either intentionally or with gross negligence (for instance, you very carelessly chose to share your PayPal ID and/or password/PIN with someone else).\nor<\/p>\n<p>There was <strong>another security /fraud problem<\/strong> and you didn’t tell us about it.\nWe will not pay you compensation for

privacy statement explains how and why PayPal collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services.\nReading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.<\/p>\n<p>“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.<\/p>\n<p>“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.<\/p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location.\nWhen you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law.\nWe may connect this information with your account, if you have one or if you

do not share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.<\/p> 6.&nbsp;How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?<strong>&nbsp.\n<\/strong>\n<p>A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.\n&nbsp;For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp.\nWhen you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp.\nExamples of account connections include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;<\/li>\n<li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials.\nor<\/li>\n<li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp.\nFor example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp.\nIf you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.\n&nbsp;We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp.\nBefore authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp.\nFor example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp;<\/p> 7.&nbsp;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?&nbsp.\n<p>When you visit our Sites, use

privacy statement explains how and why PayPal collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services.\nReading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.<\/p>\n<p>“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.<\/p>\n<p>“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.<\/p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.\n&nbsp;For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp.\nWhen you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp.\nExamples of account connections include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;<\/li>\n<li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials.\nor<\/li>\n<li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp.\nFor example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp.\nIf you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.\n&nbsp;We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp.\nBefore authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp.\nFor example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp;<\/p> 7.&nbsp;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?&nbsp.\n<p>When you visit our Sites, use

significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.\n&nbsp;For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp.\nWhen you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp.\nExamples of account connections include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;<\/li>\n<li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials.\nor<\/li>\n<li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp.\nFor example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp.\nIf you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.\n&nbsp;We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp.\nBefore authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp.\nFor example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp;<\/p> 7.&nbsp;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?&nbsp.\n<p>When you visit our Sites, use

PayPal User Agreement PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT About Your Account <p>This user agreement will be effective for all users as of September 14, 2020.\n<\/p> Welcome to PayPal!<p>These are the terms and conditions of the contract between you and PayPal (Europe) S.a r.l.\net Cie, S.C.A.\n(“PayPal”) governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services, which we call our user agreement.\nIt applies only to PayPal accounts of residents of Netherlands.\nIf you are an individual, you must be at least 18 years old and have full legal capacity to enter into a contract to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be registered in Netherlands.<\/p>\n<p>To use the PayPal services you need to open a PayPal account.\nBy opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nYou also agree to comply with the following additional documents and each of the other documents on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees page<\/li>\n<li>Privacy Statement<\/li>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>All future changes notified in the Policy Update already published on the “Legal Agreements” page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement and each of the other documents that apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may revise this user agreement and any of the documents listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide notice to you of at least two months.\nBy continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement take effect, you agree to be bound by those changes.\nIf you do not agree with any changes, you may close your account before the changes take effect.<\/p> Information about us and our service<p>PayPal’s main business is the issuance of electronic money and the provision of payment services using that electronic money.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about us and our service, you can read our Key Payment and Service Information.<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement, together with other legal terms and legally required disclosures relating to your use of our service will be made available to you at all times on the PayPal website (typically located on the “Legal Agreements” page).\nWe may also send this information to you.<\/p>\n<p>You may request a copy of any legally required disclosures (including this user agreement and the Key Payment and Service Information) from us and we will provide this to you in a form which allows you to store and reproduce the information (for example, by e-mail).\n<\/p> Opening an account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.<\/p>Personal accounts<p>With a personal account you can send and request money from friends and family and pay online for purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Holders of certain existing personal accounts may be required to upgrade their accounts (which may include providing further information to PayPal) in order to be able to use all of the current functionality available in a personal account.\n<\/p>\n<p>To use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you must open a business account or convert your personal account to a business account.<\/p>Business accounts <p>Business accounts are for people and organisations (whether incorporated or not) that primarily use PayPal to receive online payments for sales or donations.<\/p>\n<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.\nSee our Fees for further details.<\/p>\n<strong>\n<p>By opening a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\n<\/p>\n<\/strong> Commercial Entity Status <p>If the activity through your business account reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to Commercial Entity Agreements directly with our processing partners to allow you to continue accepting card-funded payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf in addition to this user agreement.\n<\/p> Safe use of your PayPal account <p>You should take reasonable steps to stop your PayPal account being misused.\nYou must maintain adequate security and control of any and all devices, items, IDs, passwords and personal identification numbers / codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nPlease see our Key Payment and Service Information for guidelines.\n<\/p>\n<p>You must comply with all reasonable instructions we may issue regarding how you can keep your Payment Instrument safe.<\/p>\n<p>We may require you to authenticate any instruction relating to your account (i.e.\ngive us the information that we need to be sure that it’s you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information – this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your instruction.<\/p>\n<p>You must keep your postal address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p>\n<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.\nIn some cases you can do this when logged into your account – in other cases you can do this directly with the third party.\nYou acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your Account to this third party.<\/p>\n<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;<\/li>\n<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.\nYou are liable to us for the actions that you authorise the third parties to carry out.\nYou will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>\n<strong>You can close your account at any time.<\/strong> See the PayPal Help Centre for how to do this.<\/p>\n<p>We may close your account at our convenience by providing you with two months’ prior notice.\nWe may also close your account at any time if:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>you are in breach of this user agreement and/or we are otherwise entitled to close your account under this user agreement;<\/li>\n<li>you do not access your account for three years.\nor<\/li>\n<li>we suspect that your account has been accessed without your authorisation.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Where we decide to close your account we will provide you with notice of account closure and where practicable, the reasons for closing your account, together with the ability to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.<\/p>\n<p>When your account is closed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>this user agreement terminates immediately, except that this user agreement survives termination to the extent and for so long as we require to deal with the closure of your account and to comply with applicable laws and regulations;<\/li>\n<li>we may cancel any pending transactions and you will forfeit any balances associated with special funding arrangements;<\/li>\n<li>we may suspend, limit or terminate your access to or use of our services, websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the services;<\/li>\n<li>you will remain liable for all outstanding obligations under this user agreement related to your account prior to closure;<\/li>\n<li>we may keep your account information in our database for the purpose of fulfilling our legal obligations.\nand<\/li>\n<li>we may retain your electronic money after closure to the extent and for the time we reasonably require to protect us and/or any third party against the risk of reversals, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities of whatever nature.\nAfter this time you will be able to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.\nPlease Contact Us if you have any questions about funds held in your account on closure.<br>\n<strong>If you are the legal representative of an incapacitated or deceased account holder, please Contact Us for assistance.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the event that we decide to discontinue any of our services or any portion or feature of our services for any reason, we will give you at least two months prior notice before discontinuing the service or feature, unless we determine in good faith that: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the service or feature must be discontinued sooner as required by law or a third-party relationship.\nor <\/li>\n<li>doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Linking and Unlinking a Funding Source <p>All money in your account is legally termed “electronic money”, which is recognised throughout the European Economic Area as a form of money suitable for use online.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can use a funding source as a way to pay us to obtain electronic money in your account or to receive withdrawals from your account, as further outlined in this user agreement (see in particular Adding or Withdrawing Money and Funding your Payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card, a prepaid card (where available) a bank account or PayPal Credit (where available) to your PayPal account as a funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may limit the availability of your funding sources to manage our risk.<\/p>\n<p>Please keep your funding source information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third-party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may contact your issuer to request this or remove your funding source from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your funding source, we will keep any preference setting attached to that funding source.\nYou may choose to confirm your card or bank account, so that we can verify that the card or bank account is valid and that you are its owner.\nWe may allow you to do this by following the Link and Confirm Card process (for cards) or the Bank Confirmation process (for bank accounts) or other processes which we may notify to you or which we may publish from time to time.<\/p>Your continuous permission for us to charge your funding sources <p>By linking a funding source to your PayPal account, you give us continuous permission to automatically charge that funding source (subject to this user agreement and the terms of any mandate (e.g.\nbank direct debit) used by the provider of that funding source to set up and maintain that authority) for the required value of the electronic money:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>to cover the payment amount (plus all transaction fees payable to us) when you use your account to send a payment to another user.\nand<\/li>\n<li>to top up your account when you use the Add Funds functionality account interface.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may charge the funding source again if the previous attempt failed.\nIf you cancel any continuous permission from your funding source, you will reimburse us for the value of any electronic money we’ve already issued for which a charge from that funding source remains outstanding.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can stop the permission by unlinking the funding source from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>SEPA is an initiative of the European Commission and European banking sector, aimed at making transactions more efficient within the European Union.\nWhenever you register a bank account with PayPal or use a new bank account for the first time as a Funding Source, you grant PayPal a SEPA Direct Debit mandate.\nIf you use a SEPA Direct Debit mandate for the continuous authority:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can access the mandate and the mandate reference number (MRN) in your PayPal account profile at any time and cancel or change the mandate for future transactions.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal will inform you of the amount of the SEPA Direct Debit payment and the time frame in which PayPal will collect the amount from the bank account together with the purchase confirmation.\nIf PayPal resubmits any SEPA Direct Debit payment request due to reversal of the original payment, there will be no (additional) information given on the amount and the time frame ahead of the resubmission.<\/li>\n<li>you can claim a refund from your bank at any time up to 8 weeks after the date on which the SEPA Direct Debit payment took place in accordance with your bank’s terms and conditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Risk of reversals to your funding source and when eCheques may arise <p>When we receive a payment from your funding source we may store the resulting electronic money in your reserve account for as long as we have reason to believe that there is risk of reversal by the funding source provider.\nThis is because we do not have all the information necessary to place the funds from your payment at your disposal in your PayPal balance while there is such a risk of reversal.\n<\/p>\n<p>When you instruct us to make a payment from your account to another user funded by a payment from your bank account and we store the resulting electronic money in this way, we call this type of payment from your bank account an “eCheque” payment.\nSee Funding payments you send from your account below for how we use eCheques.<\/p> Holding and using a PayPal balance <p>You will not receive interest or any other earnings on the money in your account.\nThis is because the money in your account is electronic money and European law forbids paying interest on electronic money.\nAlso, electronic money is not a deposit or an investment under Luxembourg law, so the Luxembourg deposit guarantee or investor indemnity schemes administered by the <i>Conseil des Protection des Deposants et des Investisseurs<\/i> cannot protect you.<\/p>\n<p>We may store and move the money in your account in and between:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the PayPal balance.\nand <\/li>\n<li>the reserve account, <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>at any given time subject further to this user agreement.<\/p>PayPal balance <p>The operational part of your account contains your PayPal balance, which is the balance of money available for payments or withdrawals.\n<\/p>\n<p>When you use our payment service to pay another user, you instruct us to transfer the money from your PayPal balance to the recipient’s account.\n<\/p>\n<p>You need to have enough PayPal balance in cleared funds to cover the amount of any payment you make and the transaction fees you owe us at the time of the payment.\nOther requirements also apply – see the section Making a Payment below.\nIf you have insufficient PayPal balance or have chosen a preferred funding source you are also requesting us to obtain funds on your behalf from your applicable funding source and issue electronic money to your PayPal balance for your payment to be made.<\/p>\n<p>When you withdraw your money you need to have enough PayPal balance to cover the value of any withdrawal at the time of the withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>See Adding or Withdrawing Money to know how to get a PayPal balance and how to withdraw it.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal balance shows a negative amount, this is the net amount you owe to us at the given time.\n<\/p> Reserve account <p>Money marked in your account overview as “pending”, “uncleared”, “held” or otherwise restricted or limited at any given time is held in the part of your account which acts as a reserve account.\nYou cannot access and use money stored in the reserve account.<\/p> Adding or Withdrawing Money Adding money <p>To get electronic money into your account you can, subject further to this user agreement:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>accept a payment in your account from someone else.\nWe may charge you fees for this.\nor<\/li>\n<li>obtain electronic money from us by paying us an equivalent amount.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can obtain electronic money from us by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>automatically using your applicable funding source(s) to cover the amount of the payments that you instruct us to send to other users (and the transaction fees payable by you to us)..\nor<\/li>\n<li>manually using the “Add Funds” function available from your account interface to pay us or instructing us to charge your funding source for the electronic money.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The execution of any payment to us from your funding source provider is your funding source provider’s legal responsibility.\nWe have no control over how long the payment to us will take.<\/p>Withdrawing money <p>If you have a PayPal balance, you may withdraw any amount by transferring it to your nominated funding source linked to your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nThis could include your bank account or debit or credit card, depending on the country in which your PayPal account is registered.<\/p>\n<p>When you instruct us to withdraw any amount of your PayPal balance, subject further to this user agreement we will:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>convert the electronic money to money that we can transfer to your nominated funding source.\nand <\/li>\n<li>instruct our own bank to transfer that money to your nominated funding source.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We aim to send the withdrawal payment instruction to our bank by the end of the next Business Day (“Business Day” means a day on which banks in Luxembourg are open to the general public).\nif there are no other delays subject to this user agreement.\nOnce our bank receives our payment instruction, we have no control over how long the payment to you will take to complete.\nAt this point, our bank, your funding source provider and the payment systems that they rely on take over responsibility for getting the money to your nominated funding source and this can affect the time it takes for you to receive your money.\nWe may allow you to withdraw the money by transferring the money to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an eligible bank account (where we make this available) through: <ul>\n<li>a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your account (this withdrawal/redemption functionality is sometimes known as “transfer to bank”).\nor<\/li>\n<li>an Instant Transfer to your bank account linked to your account.\n<br>\n<br> We may allow the above transfers to be made through the debit card attached to that bank account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>your branded MasterCard or Visa card (where we make this available).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Fees apply to withdrawals.\nWe will also disclose to you the fees in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>The funding source (for example, bank account or card) into which you request the withdrawal must be denominated in the original opening currency of your account or another currency that PayPal supports for withdrawals in your country of residence.<\/p>\n<p>You may only withdraw PayPal balance in the opening currency of your account, unless we agree otherwise.\nIn order to withdraw PayPal balance held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nOur transaction exchange rate will be used.<\/p>\n<p>This means that if you withdraw:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal balance held in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into your original opening currency.\nand<\/li>\n<li>to a funding source (for example, bank account or card) denominated in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into the currency in which the funding source is denominated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To protect you, our other users and us from loss and to allow us to comply with our anti-money laundering and other legal obligations, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorised the withdrawal or if payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview) to lift your withdrawal limit.<\/p> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies <p>When you open your account, it is configured for use with the opening currency of your account.\n<\/p>\n<p>The opening currency of your account is Euro (EUR).\n<\/p>\n<p>We may configure your account further so that you can use it to store money and send and receive payments in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nIf you hold a PayPal balance, we may allow you to convert it to balance in another currency.\n<\/p>\n<p> If your PayPal balance is not enough to cover the amount of a payment you instruct us to make in a particular currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall.\nThere may be some restrictions on where you can send payments in certain currencies.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may allow you to choose the way in which your account treats and/or converts payments received in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nTo receive money in a currency other than the opening currency of your account, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n<\/p>\n<p> Payments in certain currencies can only be received by automatic conversion of the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you receive a payment from anyone who doesn’t have a PayPal account and that payment is in a currency which your account is not currently configured to use, we may automatically convert the amount received into a currency that your account is configured to use at the time the payment is made.\n<\/p>\n<p> Please see the Withdrawing Money section above to see how withdrawals in different currencies can be made.\n<\/p>\n<p> If one of the currency balances in your account shows that you owe us an amount of funds for any reason, we may set off the amount you owe us by using funds you maintain in a different currency balance or by deducting amounts you owe us from money you receive into your account, or money you attempt to withdraw or send from your account, or in a different account, and by deducting funds from any withdrawals you attempt to make.\nIf, for a period of 21 Days, you have a PayPal balance that reflects an amount owing to us that is not in Euros, we may convert the amount you owe us to Euros.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.\nYou are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that we determine is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nWe may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.\n<\/p>How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\n<\/p>\n<p> The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).\n<\/p>\n<p> We may make a transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) available for your review during your transaction.\nIf you complete the transaction, that transaction exchange rate may apply to the payment for the transaction whenever it is processed.\nor that rate may be valid only if the payment for that transaction is processed within a limited time, as stated during the transaction.\nAfter that limited time, we may use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the transaction is processed, or not perform the currency conversion.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you have authorised a payment under a billing agreement, and we perform currency conversion for that payment, we will use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the payment transaction is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment under a billing agreement may vary.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may provide you access to a “Currency Converter” tool to see what transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) may apply for certain currency conversions.\nAny rates shown using the Currency Converter tool only apply at the time you use the tool and are subject to change.<\/p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorise us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\n<\/p>\n<p> You may have the right to have your card issuer convert the currency of the card payment into the currency in which you send the payment from your PayPal account, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether we or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.\n<\/p>\n<p> PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use existing balance or your linked bank account is the funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p> If PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup funding source to be chosen, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on the payment from your backup funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p> Where a currency conversion is offered at the point of sale by the merchant, not by PayPal, and you choose to authorise the payment transaction on the basis of the merchant's exchange rate and charges, PayPal has no liability to you for that currency conversion.\n<\/p> Account Statements and Requesting Account Records <p>Unless your Account is restricted you may view and download your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou agree to review your transactions through your PayPal account history instead of receiving periodic statements by email.\n<\/p>\n<p>Key information relating to your payments will be provided to you via e-mail and your transaction history will also be updated and made available to you at any time by logging into your account.\nYou can also access a downloadable report from your PayPal account.\nThis will show all fees incurred and any other amounts charged to your PayPal account in the relevant period.\nThe report will only be updated and made available if there has been any activity on your PayPal account or any fees have been incurred in the relevant period.\nThe way in which we provide the transaction information will allow you to store and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy.\n<\/p>\n<p> We reserve the right to charge a fee for providing you with additional information or for providing the transaction history and other information about fees in a different way but we won’t charge you for records requested in connection with your good-faith assertion of an error in your PayPal account.<\/p> Fees <p> We charge fees for our services as set out on the fees page.\n<\/p>\n<p> Quoted fees are inclusive of all applicable taxes.\nhowever, other taxes or costs may exist that are not paid through or imposed by us.\n<\/p>\n<p> You are liable for telephone charges and any charges made by your internet service provider or similar or associated charges as a result of the use by you of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may deduct our fees from your PayPal balance.\nWe may deduct our transaction-related fees from the amounts we transfer before those funds are credited to your PayPal balance.\n<\/p>\n<p> We will provide you with the details of the amounts you receive and our fees charged either by e-mail or in your transaction history (which you can access by logging into your account).\n<\/p>\n<p> If your payment requires you to pay a fee to us, we may disclose that fee to you when you provide your payment instruction to us.\n<\/p>\n<p> You cannot set off or deduct any amounts from our fees.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may make a charge for any additional services we provide outside this user agreement.\nWe will tell you of those charges when you ask for the service.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a merchant and you wish to apply for (and retain) our volume-based tiered merchant rate, the terms of the merchant rate in the Receiving Payments section below apply.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nMaking A Payment General provisions for making a payment Your payment instruction <p>We may allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in any way which we may notify to you from time to time.\nThe way in which you provide your payment instruction can depend on the type of payment you are making – for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are paying for a purchase or making a donation, many sellers and/or fund collectors allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in a dedicated PayPal checkout or other PayPal payment collection integration on their site.<\/li>\n<li>You can use the “Send Money” feature when you log into your PayPal account to send a payment to someone.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> We may require you to authenticate your instruction (i.e.\ngive us the information that we need to be sure that it’s you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information – this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your payment instruction.\n<\/p> Cancelling your payment instruction <p> Once you provide you payment instruction to us, you may not cancel it, except if it is a payment instruction under a billing agreement (see below for more details).\n<\/p> How long will my payment take? <p>Your payment to another user will leave your account [within the Business Day] after we receive your complete payment instruction.<\/p>\n<p>The payment will leave your account within two Business Days if we receive your complete payment instruction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>on a day which is not a Business Day.\nor<\/li>\n<li>after the following local cut off times on a Business Day for accounts registered in the following countries: 4pm in Netherlands.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may allow you to ask us to make your payment on a specific later date, in which case your payment will leave your account on that later date.<\/p>\n<p>Other provisions in this user agreement may cause the above timeframes to be extended.<\/p>When we may refuse to make your payment <p>We may treat your payment instruction as not complete and we may refuse to make your payment if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you do not have enough money in your PayPal balance.\n<\/li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that your linked funding sources do not have sufficient funds to cover the money required to make your payment;<\/li>\n<li>you do not provide us with all mandatory information requested in the relevant payment or checkout flows which we use to obtain your payment instructions (for instance, sufficient details of the recipient as we may request and authentication of your payment instruction);<\/li>\n<li>the payment exceeds the sending limit we tell you about when you try to make the payment.\nor<\/li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that a restricted activity has happened in relation to your account or you are otherwise in breach of this user agreement.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> When your payment is not accepted by the recipient <p> If we allow you to send a payment to someone who does not have a PayPal account, the recipient can claim the money by opening a PayPal account.\n<\/p>\n<p> If the recipient already has a PayPal account, they can refuse to accept the money.\n<\/p>\n<p> If the recipient refuses to accept the money or doesn’t open a PayPal account and claim the money within 30 days after the date it is sent, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to your PayPal account.\nSee Refunds to your account for what can happen when your PayPal account receives a refund.\n<\/p> Sending limits <p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can make, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nTo lift your sending limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).<\/p> Setting up automatic charges from your account Seller delayed payments <p> When you pay certain sellers or pay for certain purchases (for instance, purchases which have to be shipped to you or may be updated and finalised by the seller), you are providing: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an authorisation to the seller to collect your payment at a later time.\nand<\/li>\n<li>an instruction to us to automatically pay that seller when the seller requests payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> Your authorisation will typically remain valid for up to 30 days, but may remain valid for longer.\nIf you have balance, we may hold the payment amount as pending until the seller collects your payment.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied (as described in the Currency Conversion section) at the time the payment is processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> Your authorisation allows the seller to update the payment amount before the seller collects the payment (to account for any changes to the purchase that you may agree with the seller, such as additional taxes, shipping or postage charges or discounts).\nWe are not required to verify any changes at any time (including at the time the payment is transferred).\nWe may transfer any amount on the basis of your authorisation and upon receiving instructions from the seller of the final payment amount.\n<\/p> Billing agreement payments <p> You can use a billing agreement to manage payments to the same recipient(s) on an ongoing automatic basis.\nWhen you enter into a billing agreement:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>you authorise the named recipient(s) to collect payments from your account as the recipient determines (this could be for payments of amounts you owe the recipient for a purchase of goods or services under a separate contract that you have with the recipient).\nand<\/li>\n<li>you instruct PayPal to pay the named recipient(s) (or other recipient(s) that the named recipient(s) direct(s)) when the named recipient(s) request(s) PayPal to make your payment.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This makes the recipient a “trusted beneficiary” (the legal term for someone you tell us is a trusted recipient) of all your payments made under that billing agreement, so we will not normally ask you to authenticate (e.g.\nlog in) or approve these payments when they are made.\n<\/p>\n<p> Payments made under the billing agreement may be in variable amounts and may be made on various dates.\nWe are only a payment service provider so we can’t (and please don’t expect us to) know what you have or haven’t agreed with the recipient or to know why the recipient decided to collect your payment.\nWe are not obliged to verify or confirm the amount the recipient presents to us for the purpose of processing payments made under the billing agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> We use several names for payments that can be managed by a billing agreement – these include “automatic payments,” \"subscription payments\" \"recurring payments” “reference transactions” \"preauthorised transfers\" or \"preapproved payment.\" <\/p>\n<p> You can cancel your billing agreement at any time with immediate effect in your account interface or by contacting us.\nWhere a payment under that billing agreement is scheduled to be made before the end of the next Business Day after you tell us to cancel it, we may cancel your billing agreement after that payment has been made.\nIf you cancel a billing agreement, you may still owe the recipient money for goods or services that you have received but have not paid for.\n<\/p>\n<p> If we determine currency conversion is necessary for a billing agreement payment, and we perform the conversion, we will use the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the payment is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment transaction may vary.\n<\/p> Refunds to your account How refunds can happen <p> We may allow the recipient of your payment to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>refuse to accept it.\nor<\/li>\n<li>decide to accept it and then use our service to send you a refund of all or any part of the amount of the payment later.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> We will return the amount of any refused payment or refunded payment to your Balance.\nWe will return the amount of an unclaimed payment to your balance within 30 days after the date you initiated the payment.\nIf any amount of any payment is returned to you in any of the ways outlined above, we may convert the returned amount for you into either: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the currency of the balance you used for the original payment (before any conversion into the currency received by the recipient happened);<\/li>\n<li>the opening currency of your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>US dollars (opening a balance in that currency for you, if you don’t have one already).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the original payment you sent involved a currency conversion we will convert the returned amount from the currency received by the recipient as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the amount is returned within 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable on the date of the original payment, so that you receive the original amount (including the currency conversion fee you paid) in the original currency you converted for the original payment.\nand<\/li>\n<li>if the amount is returned after 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of the conversion of the returned amount.\nYou agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Unless otherwise outlined above in this section, you agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments when you convert any amount returned to you in the ways outlined above.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may also automatically withdraw the returned amount from your Balance and transfer the funds back to the funding source you used for the original payment.\nWithdrawals can also involve a currency conversion – see the section on Withdrawing money above.\n<\/p>Risks when receiving refunds <p> The returned amount could be lower in value than your original payment amount.\nThis can happen as a result of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the recipient sending you a refund lower in value than your original payment amount.\nAs we are only a payment service provider, we cannot know what you are entitled to from the original payment recipient as a refund or why the recipient sent the refund in a particular amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>transaction exchange rate fluctuations.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal is not responsible for any loss resulting from the recipient's decision to refuse or refund your payment, except to the extent that a refund sent by the recipient is a payment executed incorrectly by PayPal <\/p>\n<p>We are not liable to you for the difference between the value of your original payment and the value of the resulting refund, except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).\n<\/p> Funding Your Payment Selecting a preferred funding source <p>You may select a preferred funding source when logged into your account.\nSubject to this user agreement, the preferred funding source will be used as the default funding source for payments you send from your account.<\/p>\n<p> You can set separate preferred funding sources for some billing agreement payments.\n<\/p> Special Funding Arrangements <p> Some payments can be funded by special funding arrangements linked to your PayPal account, such as merchant/transaction specific balance, gift vouchers or other promotional funding arrangements.\nThe use and priority of these special funding arrangements are subject to further terms and conditions between you and us.\nYour account overview may show the notional amount available in your special funding arrangements to fund qualifying payments at any given time.\nThis amount does not constitute electronic money, is not deemed part of your PayPal balance and is not redeemable in cash - it only represents the amount of electronic money which we offer to issue and credit to your account at the time of (and only to immediately fund) a qualifying payment, subject to (and only for the period outlined in) the further terms and conditions of use of that special funding arrangement.\nIf your payment funded by a special funding arrangement is reversed at a later time for any reason, we will keep the amount that represents the portion of that payment that was funded by your special funding arrangement and (provided that the special funding arrangement has not already expired) reinstate the special funding arrangement.<\/p> Funding payments you send from your account <p> We will obtain electronic money for the payment you send from your account from the following sources in the following order to the extent they are available:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Special Funding Arrangements (if available for the given transaction)<\/li>\n<li>Preferred funding source (if selected and available)<\/li>\n<li>Pre-existing PayPal balance<\/li>\n<li>Bank account (instant transfer via bank mandate)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal Credit (where available)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal-branded debit card (where available)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal-branded credit card (where available)<\/li>\n<li>Debit card<\/li>\n<li>Credit card<\/li>\n<li>Bank account (eCheque) <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you have linked a bank account as a funding source we may choose to offer you access to Pay After Delivery, which allows you to defer a charge to this bank account for a period of time.\nIf you are offered and choose to use this service, the Pay After Delivery Terms will apply.<\/p> PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection.\nWhen applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection.\nPayPal’s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn’t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn’t what you ordered (referred to as a “Significantly Not as Described” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the PayPal Buyer Protection, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.<\/p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection.<\/p>Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>\n<strong>will not<\/strong>\n<\/em> qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not Received claim, if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller’s retail point of sale, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions or<\/li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller’s description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as “new” but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn’t receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as “used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal Buyer Protection <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats, except for personally portable light vehicles used for recreational purposes like bicycles and wheeled hoverboards.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms, as well as payments made on crowdlending platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller’s retail point of sale, , except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Payments to state-run bodies, (except for state-owned enterprises) or traders acting on mandates received from state-run bodies.<\/li>\n<li>Payment equivalent to cash, including stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal Payments.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay&nbsp.\ni.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made in respect of gold (whether in physical form or in exchange-traded form).<\/li>\n<\/ul> Transaction eligibility for PayPal Buyer Protection <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, then follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery related to such purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you’re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the&nbsp;<strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>&nbsp;to pursue a claim under our PayPal Buyer Protection.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within&nbsp;180 days&nbsp;of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal&nbsp;account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days&nbsp;after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nIf you are making an Item Not Received claim, PayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.<\/p>\n<p>Step 3:&nbsp;<strong>Respond to PayPal’s requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4:&nbsp;<strong>Comply with PayPal’s shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you’re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item&nbsp;back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide Proof of Delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Step 5:&nbsp;<strong>PayPal will make a final decision&nbsp;<\/strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p> Event tickets <p>In certain cases, if you purchase a ticket or pay for the right to attend an event from a payment recipient who is a UK registered PayPal account holder (“Event”), all monies paid by you may be held by PayPal on trust for you, so that the beneficial interest in such monies remains with you until the performance of the Event in question.<\/p>Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal’s Buyer Protection.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don’t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our PayPal Buyer Protection, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can’t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we’ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won’t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).<\/p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller’s return policy.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nReceiving Payments General provisions for receiving payments <p>PayPal may allow anybody (with or without an account) to make a payment resulting in the issuance or transfer of electronic money to your account.\n<\/p>\n<p>By integrating (including by having already integrated) into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>The receipt of a payment into your account does not equate to the receipt of cleared funds.\nA notification that a payment has been sent to you does not amount to a receipt of electronic money in your account unless you have accepted the payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may allow you to accept payments in any currency supported by our Service from time to time.\n<\/p>\n<p>Where you (instead of PayPal) offer the payer at the point of sale a currency conversion of an amount you receive through PayPal, you will inform the buyer of the exchange rate and any charges that will be applied to the payment transaction.\nPayPal has no liability to any buyer if you fail to inform the buyer of the exchange rate and charges.\nYou acknowledge that if you fail to disclose the exchange rate and charges to the buyer this may constitute a criminal offence by you.<\/p>\n<p>Any payment sent to you may be subject to a reversal, payment review, limitation, reserve or hold as allowed under this user agreement.\n<\/p>Receiving limits <p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can receive, including money you receive for purchases.\nTo lift your receiving limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).<\/p>\n<strong>New checkout solution included in the PayPal Commerce Platform<\/strong>\n<p>The PayPal Commerce Platform includes our new checkout solution.&nbsp.\nThe checkout solution consists of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>our dedicated bundled checkout capability in your online checkout/platform to enable a buyer with or without an account to send a payment to your account.\nand<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fraud Protection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may offer you all, any part or any combination of parts of the checkout solution.\nIf we offer you the checkout solution and you choose to use it, in addition to this user agreement, you agree to the following further terms relating to the following capabilities:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement<\/strong>, when you use our APM functionality as part of the checkout solution.\nand<\/li>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Online Card Payment Services Agreement<\/strong>, when you use:

<strong>Fees<\/strong>&nbsp;for using the checkout solution apply.<\/p> Rules about surcharging <p>PayPal does not encourage surcharging because it is a commercial practice that can penalise the consumer and create unnecessary confusion, friction and abandonment at checkout.\n<\/p>\n<p>You may only surcharge for the use of our services in compliance with any law applicable to you and not in excess of the surcharges that you apply for the use of other payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>If you surcharge a buyer, you, and not we, will inform the buyer of the requested charge.\nWe are not liable to any buyer where you have failed to inform the buyer of any surcharge.\nYou acknowledge that you could be committing a criminal offence if you surcharge and/or fail to disclose any form of surcharge to a buyer.<\/p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal as a payment method or mark at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or substantially similar:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>logo placement,<\/li>\n<li>position within any point of sale,<\/li>\n<li>treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, or fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterise PayPal as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal.<\/p> Taxes and information reporting <p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nWe are not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.\nAs a bank service provider no sales tax applies to the PayPal services in the EU.<\/p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy.<\/p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace’s or the third party application’s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p>\n<p>We may allow you to authorise certain marketplaces to use your account to pay amounts you owe to the marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) arising from a claim under the terms of the marketplace’s own resolution process (“<strong>Marketplace Due Amounts<\/strong>”).\nIf you give such an authorisation and the marketplace notifies us of the claim, you instruct us to process payments of all and any Marketplace Due Amounts relating to that claim from your PayPal account to that marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) according to the marketplace’s instructions to us.\nWe may treat your instruction for the payment of any given Marketplace Due Amount as cancelled if we decide that the claim would have been determined in your favour had it been filed as a claim with us.\nYou can also cancel this instruction by contacting us.\nAll claims filed directly with the marketplace are governed by the marketplace’s own policy only.\nThe terms of the PayPal Seller Protection Programme do not cover you for claims filed by your buyers directly with the marketplace.<\/p> Accepting billing agreement payments <p>If we allow you to accept payments from a payer under a billing agreement, when you present to us a payment request under that billing agreement, you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>warrant to us that the amounts you present have been agreed and consented to by the payer whose account will be deducted (including changes to those amounts) and that you will give prior notice of the deduction to the payer.\nand<\/li>\n<li>agree that you will notify the payer at least 4 weeks in advance of the amount they will collect if that amount has increased in such a manner that the payer could not have reasonably expected to pay such an amount, taking into account the payer’s previous spending patterns and the circumstances of the payment and that you are liable to us for any refunds of that payment in accordance with the terms of this user agreement.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Refunds and reversals of payments <p>When you receive a payment, it could be refunded or reversed.\nWe may allow you to send to the payer a refund of the payment.\nWe may carry out a reversal of your payment in certain circumstances.\nSee the rest of this section for more details.<\/p>Refunds <p>You alone are (and PayPal is not) responsible for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>your legal and contractual obligations towards the payer for any amount you return to the payer.\nand<\/li>\n<li>any difference between the cost to the payer of making the original payment and the value of the amount returned to the payer (for instance, as a result of transaction exchange rate fluctuations) except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).<br>\n<br>See our fees for details of the fees you paid to us as the recipient of the original payment which we retain when you use the special commercial transaction refund functionality in your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nexcept to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).<\/li>\n<\/ul>Reversals <p>If you receive a payment in your account, you owe us the full amount of the payment and our losses arising from processing the payment.\nThis can include our liability (including any fees, charges and penalties) towards any third party (including the payer and the payer’s funding source provider).<\/p>\n<p>A reversal happens when we exercise our right to set off the above amounts from your account under the section Reimbursement for your liability in this user agreement.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount you owe us in that currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall and you will be charged for the currency conversion.\nThis means that, for example, if you are a seller, amounts of payments received in your account may be removed from your account after you have delivered any goods or services sold.<\/p>\n<p>A reversal can happen when:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we reimburse the payer in respect of a PayPal Buyer Protection claim the payer made against you.<\/li>\n<li>we compensate the payer or the payer’s funding source provider (or both) because we receive a claim from the payer or their funding source provider for the payment amount under the reversal process used by that funding source provider.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For instance:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the payer used a card to fund the payment to you the payer could pursue a “chargeback” with the card issuer.\nThe card issuer, not us, determines whether the payer is successful when they pursue a chargeback.\nYou can find out more about chargebacks by reviewing our Chargeback Guide, accessible via the PayPal Security Centre and the section called: “Selling Safely”.\nThe PayPal Security Centre is accessed via the PayPal website.\nWe charge you a fee for receiving a chargeback claim.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If the payer used a bank account to fund the payment the payer or the bank could pursue a bank reversal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The amount claimed may be greater than the original amount you received due to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the time of payment and the time of the claim.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we may have to compensate your payer when they claimed that there was a problem with their payment (including that their payment was unauthorised or incorrect or that their billing agreement payment was not expected) – see Resolving Problems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>we are entitled to carry out the reversal for any other reason under this user agreement, including the provision Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Impact of PayPal Buyer Protection on sellers <p> You should read our Buyer Protection Policy and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection made available by PayPal to buyers in each of those countries as buyers’ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about the PayPal Buyer Protection on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer’s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding PayPal Buyer Protection listed on that page or in the corresponding user agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under&nbsp;PayPal Buyer Protection&nbsp.\nin any country:<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back plus pay for return shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/p>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay’s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your cash account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nplace a&nbsp;hold&nbsp;on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor<\/p>\n<p>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/p> PayPal Seller Protection What’s eligible <p>If you have received more than €100,000 per month at least once over a consecutive period of 6 months on your PayPal Account and/or if you are applying surcharge for the use of PayPal (when the law applicable to you allows you to apply surcharge), you are not eligible for PayPal seller protection and this section applies to you unless otherwise agreed between you and PayPal.\nPayPal will review your eligibility for seller protection in October and April of each calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks,&nbsp;you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Seller Protection.\nWhen it applies, PayPal Seller Protection entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program<\/p>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an “Unauthorized Transaction” claim) and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They didn’t receive the item from you (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal Seller Protection as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various PayPal Buyer protection processes on sellers.<\/p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the Netherlands.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for items subject to the&nbsp;<strong>Intangible Goods Additional

the buyer paid for the transaction in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person, provided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the&nbsp;<strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.&nbsp;If you do not respond to PayPal’s request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>Provide proof of shipment or delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The payment must be marked \"eligible\" or \"partially eligible\" in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims for PayPal Seller Protection on the \"Transaction Details\" page.<\/li>\n<li>You must accept a single payment from one PayPal Account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Seller Protection program.\nPayPal will make a decision, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements, any information or documentation provided during the resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>Item Not Received additional requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection program for a buyer’s Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements&nbsp.\nlisted above and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked “eligible” for PayPal’s Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements<\/li>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third party or if you have a native app integration.<\/li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.<\/li>\n<li>If the transaction is a payment for digital goods or licenses for digital content, you must have paid Standard Transaction Fees on the sale (this does not apply to payments for other Intangible Goods).<\/li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of delivery for Intangible Goods.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as:<\/p>\n<p>Proof of shipment<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery<\/p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the Transaction Details page, or<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing

(based on the currency of the payment) listed in the&nbsp;<strong>signature confirmation threshold table<\/strong>.\nSignature confirmation is online documentation, viewable at the shipping company’s website, indicating that the item was signed for.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> Your choice of carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.\nPlease ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide ‘delivered’ status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of delivery for intangible goods:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>QR Code Transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of shipment or proof of delivery:<\/p>\n<p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.\nCompelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Received or accessed by the recipient<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For QR code transactions you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information to the

payment.\nor<\/li>\n<li>b.\nThe timeframe for delivery of the goods or performance of the services for which you receive payment (e.g.\nsales of event tickets months in advance of the event date can

account while it is suspended or has been closed.\nYou must ensure that all agreements with sellers or other third parties that involve third party initiated payments (including billing agreement payments) set up from your account are cancelled immediately upon the termination, suspension or closure of your account.\nYou remain liable under this user agreement in respect of all charges and other amounts incurred through the use of your account at any time, irrespective of termination, suspension or closure.<\/p> Holds, Limitations, and Reserves What are holds, limitations and reserves? <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nIf we take any of the actions described here, we will normally notify you of our actions, but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example if you are in breach of this user agreement or we consider it advisable for security reasons), take any of these actions without prior notice to you.<\/p>\n<p>To request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that any funds held under this user agreement may be placed in your reserve account and that you will provide to us any information as we may reasonably request to allow us to determine whether the risk has passed.<\/p>Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.&nbsp.\nWhen PayPal places a hold on a payment amount, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\n&nbsp;PayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include where we have reason to believe that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transactions are higher risk, this can be where the transaction involves the sale of goods or services in a high risk category, or other facts known to us typically resulting in an increased number of chargebacks, other claims or disputes or to be often involved in fraud or illegal activity;<\/li>\n<li>There is a sudden and abnormal change in a PayPal account holder’s selling activity including an increase in the number of chargebacks, reversals, or buyer complaints received in relation to such PayPal account;<\/li>\n<li>Any PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities;<\/li>\n<li>A PayPal account involved in the transaction may have been compromised, or that stolen financial details (bank or credit card) are used for the payment, or otherwise a transaction has not been properly authorised;<\/li>\n<li>A user is trying to send or withdraw funds they received fraudulently;<\/li>\n<li>A user has not provided sufficient Information to us to enable us to verify their identity or the identity of their business and/or the user has a limited trading history with PayPal;<\/li>\n<li>A payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer files a chargeback, reversal or PayPal Buyer Protection claim on a payment you received.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer files a claim under a marketplace's resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of reversal of funds in your account to your funding source.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).<\/li>\n<\/ul>Payment review <p>When we identify a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nThis may be because we have the reasonable suspicion that the payer’s PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities or for other reasons as determined by us in our reasonable discretion.&nbsp.\nThis may include where there is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).<\/p>\n<p>If a payment is subject to payment review, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>execute the payment order initiated by the buyer;<\/li>\n<li>in our discretion, immediately upon such execution restrict the payer’s account;<\/li>\n<li>place a hold on the payment [in the payer’s account].\nand/or<\/li>\n<li>notify the recipient to delay the delivery of the purchase paid for by the payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If we don’t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\n<p>All payments that complete payment review are still subject to being reversed under the terms of this user agreement but will be Seller Protection eligible if they meet the Seller Protection requirements.\nPayPal will provide notices to you by email and/or in the transaction history tab of your PayPal account.\nA payment subject to payment review is a review of the payment only and is implemented to reduce the risk of PayPal users receiving high risk transactions.\nA payment subject to payment review is neither a review nor a representation by PayPal as to the commercial dealings, character or reputation of a party to the payment transaction and should not be considered as a lessening of the respect of any person.<\/p>Holds related to your instructions <p>Certain PayPal functionality may allow you (whether directly or via someone you permit to act on your behalf, like an online marketplace platform on which you transact as a seller) to instruct us to hold your funds (including the proceeds of payments you receive using PayPal) in your reserve account.<\/p>\n<p>In such a case we will show you the availability status of those funds in your balance – the status descriptions may differ according to the functionality you used to instruct us to place the hold.\nWe will release the hold on the funds according to the instruction that you (or the entity that you have permitted to act on your behalf) give to us, subject to the rest of this user agreement.<\/p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice&nbsp;<strong>restricted activities<\/strong>, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.&nbsp.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including where we have reason to believe that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, then we’ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>Someone has used your card or bank account without your permission, for example if your debit or credit card issuer or bank alerts us to this.<\/li>\n<li>You have breached this user agreement or violated the&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>Your performance as a seller indicate your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you’ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities&nbsp;above).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also limit your PayPal account in order to comply with applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>Reserves <p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.&nbsp.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the funds in your PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A “rolling reserve”<\/strong>&nbsp;is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A “minimum reserve”<\/strong>&nbsp;is a specific minimum amount of funds that you’re required to keep available in your balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your PayPal account, the money will be moved to your reserve account and shown as “pending” and we’ll notify you about it.<\/p>\n<p>If we change the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you about it as well.<\/p>\n<p>You will undertake, at your own expense, any further action required to establish a reserve or other form of security in a manner reasonably determined by us.&nbsp.\nThis can involve executing any necessary documents and registering any form of document reasonably required by us to allow us to perfect any form of security interest.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nRESOLVING PROBLEMS <strong>\n<p>We strongly recommend that you monitor your account closely on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<\/strong> If you find a problem… <p>If you have any reason to believe that there is a problem with your account or our service, follow these steps:<\/p> Step 1: Take a few moments to identify the type of problem: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Unexpected billing agreement payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where you entered into a billing agreement but a payment was sent from your account to another PayPal account under that billing agreement where:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you didn’t agree with the recipient in advance the exact payment amount.\nand<\/li>\n<li>the payment amount ended up being more than you could reasonably have expected to pay based on previous charges and the other circumstances.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Incorrect payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where a payment sent from your account to another PayPal account was not sent as you specified when you asked us to make it (e.g.\nfor the wrong amount, delayed, wrong recipient) or you received such a payment.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Security / Fraud problem<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Unauthorised payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where a payment sent from your account wasn’t authorised by you (or anyone who’s authorised to make payments for you).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Another type of security / fraud problem<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where there was another security or fraud problem, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>there was some other unauthorised access to your account.<\/li>\n<li>your password or PIN was compromised.<\/li>\n<li>a device you have used to access our services was lost, stolen or deactivated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<br>\n<p>Follow the steps in the section “<strong>What to do in case of a security problem<\/strong>” in the <strong>\n<u>Key Payment and Service Information<\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;as soon as possible before contacting us.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Another type of problem <\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where there was another type of problem with your account or with our service which is not mentioned above.\nFor instance, we may have made a factual, computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal when you added money to or withdrew money from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If a purchase that you paid for with PayPal was not as described or you have not received the purchase, the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy, not this section, may apply.&nbsp.\nPlease see the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy&nbsp;for how to deal with these particular problems.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Step 2: Tell us about the problem <p>\n<strong>\n<u>Contact us&nbsp;as soon as possible<\/u>\n<\/strong> to tell us about the problem (including the type of problem you are contacting us about so that we can help you as quickly as we can).<\/p>\n<p>You must give us all the information we reasonably request as to the circumstances of the problem and take all reasonable steps we request to assist us in our investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If you tell us about your problem orally, we may require that you report your problem in writing within 10&nbsp;<strong>Business Days<\/strong> after that.<\/p>\n<p>We may provide third parties with information we consider relevant in such circumstances in accordance with our <strong>\n<u>Privacy Policy<\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;(alternatively known as our Privacy Statement).<\/p> How we will help...\n<p>Subject to the rest of this user agreement, we aim to investigate the problem and work with you to resolve it within 60 days.\nIn addition, if your problem is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an unexpected billing agreement payment, <\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;within 10 Business Days after telling us about it we will either: <ul>\n<li>reimburse you for the payment amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>explain why we cannot reimburse you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an incorrect payment to another Paypal account, <\/u>\n<\/strong>we will:<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>make immediate efforts to trace the payment and notify you of the outcome without charge to you;<\/li>\n<li>compensate you as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) by putting your account in the state it would have been in had the incorrect payment been sent as actually specified by the sender.\nThis means: <ul>\n<li>If the incorrect payment resulted in you having less money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we will credit your account for the difference.<\/li>\n<li>If the incorrect payment resulted in you having more money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we may debit the extra funds from your&nbsp;account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>reimburse you in your account for your losses or damages directly and reasonably foreseeably caused by the incorrect payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an unauthorised payment to another PayPal account, <\/u>\n<\/strong>as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) we will put your account back to where it would have been had the payment never happened.&nbsp.\nThis can include a <u>reimbursement<\/u> of your payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul> When we can’t compensate you...\n<p>You are not entitled to any financial compensation from us as outlined above and you will owe to us (and we may reverse from your account) any compensation you have already received from us if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You do not give us all the information we reasonably requested as to the circumstances of the problem (including, if you tell us about your problem orally, you fail to comply with our request that you tell us about your problem in writing within 10&nbsp;<strong>Business Days<\/strong>);<\/li>\n<li>You do not take all reasonable steps that we request to assist us in our investigation;<\/li>\n<li>We can show that you acted fraudulently;<\/li>\n<li>We can show that circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood or loss of internet connection) caused the problem, despite our reasonable precautions;<\/li>\n<li>We have reason to believe otherwise that there is no problem which entitles you to compensation.\nor<\/li>\n<li>In respect of the following specific problems:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Unexpected billing agreement payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Incorrect payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Unauthorised payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 8 weeks after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>You agreed for us to make your payment and the details were made available to you by us or the merchant at least 4 weeks before the payment was made.<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that you gave us the wrong payment details.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that the payment was sent as the payer specified when the payer asked us to make it.\nor<\/p>\n<p>Through no fault of ours, you did not have enough PayPal balance to complete the payment.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/p>\n<p>A delay which you claimed caused the incorrect payment actually resulted from PayPal applying&nbsp;a <strong>hold, limitation or reserve <\/strong>\n<strong>under this user agreement<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that the payment was made because you did not keep your account safe either intentionally or with gross negligence (for instance, you very carelessly chose to share your PayPal ID and/or password/PIN with someone else).\nor<\/p>\n<p>There was <strong>another security /fraud problem<\/strong> and you didn’t tell us about it.\nWe will not pay you compensation for any unauthorised payments made from your account before you told us about that problem.\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes we might spot the problem first.&nbsp.\nIf we need to notify you about the problem, we will ordinarily do so through the Secure Messaging Centre, which you need to log into your account to access.\nIf you should take action urgently, we may also use other means such as email to request action.<\/p>\n<p>If a payment was made from us to your funding source by way of mistake, we may correct the mistake by debiting or crediting (as the case may be) your appropriate funding source(s).<\/p> Complaints Reporting disputes between you and PayPal regarding our services<p>Contact us&nbsp;to report disputes between you and PayPal regarding our services.<\/p>\n<p>If a dispute

services, applications, messaging, and tools.<\/p>\n<p>The specific names and types of the cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies we use may change from time to time.\nIn order to help

(typically made up of letters and numbers) placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message.\nCookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or

your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a “device”) that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools.<\/p>\n<p>The specific names and types of the cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies we use may change from time to time.\nIn order to help you better understand this Policy and our use of such technologies we have provided the following limited terminology and definitions:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies<\/strong>&nbsp;– Small text files (typically made up of letters and numbers) placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message.\nCookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or browser.\nThere are several types of cookies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your actions during that particular browser

information to target advertising to you on or off our sites.<\/p>\n<p>We may use the terms “cookies” or “similar technologies” interchangeably in our policies to refer to all technologies that we may

store relevant information in your browser or device and later read that information in order to identify your device to our servers or internal systems.\nWhere applicable, we protect our cookies and other similar technologies to help ensure that only we and/or our authorized service providers can interpret them by assigning them a unique identifier that is designed for interpretation only by

PayPal User Agreement PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT About Your Account <p>This user agreement will be effective for all users as of September 14, 2020.\n<\/p> Welcome to PayPal!<p>These are the terms and conditions of the contract between you and PayPal (Europe) S.a r.l.\net Cie, S.C.A.\n(“PayPal”) governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services, which we call our user agreement.\nIt applies only to PayPal accounts of residents of Netherlands.\nIf you are an individual, you must be at least 18 years old and have full legal capacity to enter into a contract to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be registered in Netherlands.<\/p>\n<p>To use the PayPal services you need to open a PayPal account.\nBy opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nYou also agree to comply with the following additional documents and each of the other documents on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees page<\/li>\n<li>Privacy Statement<\/li>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>All future changes notified in the Policy Update already published on the “Legal Agreements” page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement and each of the other documents that apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may revise this user agreement and any of the documents listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide notice to you of at least two months.\nBy continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement take effect, you agree to be bound by those changes.\nIf you do not agree with any changes, you may close your account before the changes take effect.<\/p> Information about us and our service<p>PayPal’s main business is the issuance of electronic money and the provision of payment services using that electronic money.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about us and our service, you can read our Key Payment and Service Information.<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement, together with other legal terms and legally required disclosures relating to your use of our service will be made available to you at all times on the PayPal website (typically located on the “Legal Agreements” page).\nWe may also send this information to you.<\/p>\n<p>You may request a copy of any legally required disclosures (including this user agreement and the Key Payment and Service Information) from us and we will provide this to you in a form which allows you to store and reproduce the information (for example, by e-mail).\n<\/p> Opening an account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.<\/p>Personal accounts<p>With a personal account you can send and request money from friends and family and pay online for purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Holders of certain existing personal accounts may be required to upgrade their accounts (which may include providing further information to PayPal) in order to be able to use all of the current functionality available in a personal account.\n<\/p>\n<p>To use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you must open a business account or convert your personal account to a business account.<\/p>Business accounts <p>Business accounts are for people and organisations (whether incorporated or not) that primarily use PayPal to receive online payments for sales or donations.<\/p>\n<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.\nSee our Fees for further details.<\/p>\n<strong>\n<p>By opening a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\n<\/p>\n<\/strong> Commercial Entity Status <p>If the activity through your business account reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to Commercial Entity Agreements directly with our processing partners to allow you to continue accepting card-funded payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf in addition to this user agreement.\n<\/p> Safe use of your PayPal account <p>You should take reasonable steps to stop your PayPal account being misused.\nYou must maintain adequate security and control of any and all devices, items, IDs, passwords and personal identification numbers / codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nPlease see our Key Payment and Service Information for guidelines.\n<\/p>\n<p>You must comply with all reasonable instructions we may issue regarding how you can keep your Payment Instrument safe.<\/p>\n<p>We may require you to authenticate any instruction relating to your account (i.e.\ngive us the information that we need to be sure that it’s you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information – this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your instruction.<\/p>\n<p>You must keep your postal address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p>\n<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.\nIn some cases you can do this when logged into your account – in other cases you can do this directly with the third party.\nYou acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your Account to this third party.<\/p>\n<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;<\/li>\n<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.\nYou are liable to us for the actions that you authorise the third parties to carry out.\nYou will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>\n<strong>You can close your account at any time.<\/strong> See the PayPal Help Centre for how to do this.<\/p>\n<p>We may close your account at our convenience by providing you with two months’ prior notice.\nWe may also close your account at any time if:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>you are in breach of this user agreement and/or we are otherwise entitled to close your account under this user agreement;<\/li>\n<li>you do not access your account for three years.\nor<\/li>\n<li>we suspect that your account has been accessed without your authorisation.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Where we decide to close your account we will provide you with notice of account closure and where practicable, the reasons for closing your account, together with the ability to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.<\/p>\n<p>When your account is closed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>this user agreement terminates immediately, except that this user agreement survives termination to the extent and for so long as we require to deal with the closure of your account and to comply with applicable laws and regulations;<\/li>\n<li>we may cancel any pending transactions and you will forfeit any balances associated with special funding arrangements;<\/li>\n<li>we may suspend, limit or terminate your access to or use of our services, websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the services;<\/li>\n<li>you will remain liable for all outstanding obligations under this user agreement related to your account prior to closure;<\/li>\n<li>we may keep your account information in our database for the purpose of fulfilling our legal obligations.\nand<\/li>\n<li>we may retain your electronic money after closure to the extent and for the time we reasonably require to protect us and/or any third party against the risk of reversals, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities of whatever nature.\nAfter this time you will be able to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.\nPlease Contact Us if you have any questions about funds held in your account on closure.<br>\n<strong>If you are the legal representative of an incapacitated or deceased account holder, please Contact Us for assistance.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the event that we decide to discontinue any of our services or any portion or feature of our services for any reason, we will give you at least two months prior notice before discontinuing the service or feature, unless we determine in good faith that: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the service or feature must be discontinued sooner as required by law or a third-party relationship.\nor <\/li>\n<li>doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Linking and Unlinking a Funding Source <p>All money in your account is legally termed “electronic money”, which is recognised throughout the European Economic Area as a form of money suitable for use online.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can use a funding source as a way to pay us to obtain electronic money in your account or to receive withdrawals from your account, as further outlined in this user agreement (see in particular Adding or Withdrawing Money and Funding your Payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card, a prepaid card (where available) a bank account or PayPal Credit (where available) to your PayPal account as a funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may limit the availability of your funding sources to manage our risk.<\/p>\n<p>Please keep your funding source information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third-party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may contact your issuer to request this or remove your funding source from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your funding source, we will keep any preference setting attached to that funding source.\nYou may choose to confirm your card or bank account, so that we can verify that the card or bank account is valid and that you are its owner.\nWe may allow you to do this by following the Link and Confirm Card process (for cards) or the Bank Confirmation process (for bank accounts) or other processes which we may notify to you or which we may publish from time to time.<\/p>Your continuous permission for us to charge your funding sources <p>By linking a funding source to your PayPal account, you give us continuous permission to automatically charge that funding source (subject to this user agreement and the terms of any mandate (e.g.\nbank direct debit) used by the provider of that funding source to set up and maintain that authority) for the required value of the electronic money:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>to cover the payment amount (plus all transaction fees payable to us) when you use your account to send a payment to another user.\nand<\/li>\n<li>to top up your account when you use the Add Funds functionality account interface.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may charge the funding source again if the previous attempt failed.\nIf you cancel any continuous permission from your funding source, you will reimburse us for the value of any electronic money we’ve already issued for which a charge from that funding source remains outstanding.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can stop the permission by unlinking the funding source from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>SEPA is an initiative of the European Commission and European banking sector, aimed at making transactions more efficient within the European Union.\nWhenever you register a bank account with PayPal or use a new bank account for the first time as a Funding Source, you grant PayPal a SEPA Direct Debit mandate.\nIf you use a SEPA Direct Debit mandate for the continuous authority:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can access the mandate and the mandate reference number (MRN) in your PayPal account profile at any time and cancel or change the mandate for future transactions.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal will inform you of the amount of the SEPA Direct Debit payment and the time frame in which PayPal will collect the amount from the bank account together with the purchase confirmation.\nIf PayPal resubmits any SEPA Direct Debit payment request due to reversal of the original payment, there will be no (additional) information given on the amount and the time frame ahead of the resubmission.<\/li>\n<li>you can claim a refund from your bank at any time up to 8 weeks after the date on which the SEPA Direct Debit payment took place in accordance with your bank’s terms and conditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Risk of reversals to your funding source and when eCheques may arise <p>When we receive a payment from your funding source we may store the resulting electronic money in your reserve account for as long as we have reason to believe that there is risk of reversal by the funding source provider.\nThis is because we do not have all the information necessary to place the funds from your payment at your disposal in your PayPal balance while there is such a risk of reversal.\n<\/p>\n<p>When you instruct us to make a payment from your account to another user funded by a payment from your bank account and we store the resulting electronic money in this way, we call this type of payment from your bank account an “eCheque” payment.\nSee Funding payments you send from your account below for how we use eCheques.<\/p> Holding and using a PayPal balance <p>You will not receive interest or any other earnings on the money in your account.\nThis is because the money in your account is electronic money and European law forbids paying interest on electronic money.\nAlso, electronic money is not a deposit or an investment under Luxembourg law, so the Luxembourg deposit guarantee or investor indemnity schemes administered by the <i>Conseil des Protection des Deposants et des Investisseurs<\/i> cannot protect you.<\/p>\n<p>We may store and move the money in your account in and between:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the PayPal balance.\nand <\/li>\n<li>the reserve account, <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>at any given time subject further to this user agreement.<\/p>PayPal balance <p>The operational part of your account contains your PayPal balance, which is the balance of money available for payments or withdrawals.\n<\/p>\n<p>When you use our payment service to pay another user, you instruct us to transfer the money from your PayPal balance to the recipient’s account.\n<\/p>\n<p>You need to have enough PayPal balance in cleared funds to cover the amount of any payment you make and the transaction fees you owe us at the time of the payment.\nOther requirements also apply – see the section Making a Payment below.\nIf you have insufficient PayPal balance or have chosen a preferred funding source you are also requesting us to obtain funds on your behalf from your applicable funding source and issue electronic money to your PayPal balance for your payment to be made.<\/p>\n<p>When you withdraw your money you need to have enough PayPal balance to cover the value of any withdrawal at the time of the withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>See Adding or Withdrawing Money to know how to get a PayPal balance and how to withdraw it.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal balance shows a negative amount, this is the net amount you owe to us at the given time.\n<\/p> Reserve account <p>Money marked in your account overview as “pending”, “uncleared”, “held” or otherwise restricted or limited at any given time is held in the part of your account which acts as a reserve account.\nYou cannot access and use money stored in the reserve account.<\/p> Adding or Withdrawing Money Adding money <p>To get electronic money into your account you can, subject further to this user agreement:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>accept a payment in your account from someone else.\nWe may charge you fees for this.\nor<\/li>\n<li>obtain electronic money from us by paying us an equivalent amount.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can obtain electronic money from us by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>automatically using your applicable funding source(s) to cover the amount of the payments that you instruct us to send to other users (and the transaction fees payable by you to us)..\nor<\/li>\n<li>manually using the “Add Funds” function available from your account interface to pay us or instructing us to charge your funding source for the electronic money.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The execution of any payment to us from your funding source provider is your funding source provider’s legal responsibility.\nWe have no control over how long the payment to us will take.<\/p>Withdrawing money <p>If you have a PayPal balance, you may withdraw any amount by transferring it to your nominated funding source linked to your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nThis could include your bank account or debit or credit card, depending on the country in which your PayPal account is registered.<\/p>\n<p>When you instruct us to withdraw any amount of your PayPal balance, subject further to this user agreement we will:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>convert the electronic money to money that we can transfer to your nominated funding source.\nand <\/li>\n<li>instruct our own bank to transfer that money to your nominated funding source.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We aim to send the withdrawal payment instruction to our bank by the end of the next Business Day (“Business Day” means a day on which banks in Luxembourg are open to the general public).\nif there are no other delays subject to this user agreement.\nOnce our bank receives our payment instruction, we have no control over how long the payment to you will take to complete.\nAt this point, our bank, your funding source provider and the payment systems that they rely on take over responsibility for getting the money to your nominated funding source and this can affect the time it takes for you to receive your money.\nWe may allow you to withdraw the money by transferring the money to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an eligible bank account (where we make this available) through: <ul>\n<li>a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your account (this withdrawal/redemption functionality is sometimes known as “transfer to bank”).\nor<\/li>\n<li>an Instant Transfer to your bank account linked to your account.\n<br>\n<br> We may allow the above transfers to be made through the debit card attached to that bank account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>your branded MasterCard or Visa card (where we make this available).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Fees apply to withdrawals.\nWe will also disclose to you the fees in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>The funding source (for example, bank account or card) into which you request the withdrawal must be denominated in the original opening currency of your account or another currency that PayPal supports for withdrawals in your country of residence.<\/p>\n<p>You may only withdraw PayPal balance in the opening currency of your account, unless we agree otherwise.\nIn order to withdraw PayPal balance held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nOur transaction exchange rate will be used.<\/p>\n<p>This means that if you withdraw:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal balance held in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into your original opening currency.\nand<\/li>\n<li>to a funding source (for example, bank account or card) denominated in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into the currency in which the funding source is denominated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To protect you, our other users and us from loss and to allow us to comply with our anti-money laundering and other legal obligations, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorised the withdrawal or if payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview) to lift your withdrawal limit.<\/p> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies <p>When you open your account, it is configured for use with the opening currency of your account.\n<\/p>\n<p>The opening currency of your account is Euro (EUR).\n<\/p>\n<p>We may configure your account further so that you can use it to store money and send and receive payments in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nIf you hold a PayPal balance, we may allow you to convert it to balance in another currency.\n<\/p>\n<p> If your PayPal balance is not enough to cover the amount of a payment you instruct us to make in a particular currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall.\nThere may be some restrictions on where you can send payments in certain currencies.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may allow you to choose the way in which your account treats and/or converts payments received in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nTo receive money in a currency other than the opening currency of your account, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n<\/p>\n<p> Payments in certain currencies can only be received by automatic conversion of the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you receive a payment from anyone who doesn’t have a PayPal account and that payment is in a currency which your account is not currently configured to use, we may automatically convert the amount received into a currency that your account is configured to use at the time the payment is made.\n<\/p>\n<p> Please see the Withdrawing Money section above to see how withdrawals in different currencies can be made.\n<\/p>\n<p> If one of the currency balances in your account shows that you owe us an amount of funds for any reason, we may set off the amount you owe us by using funds you maintain in a different currency balance or by deducting amounts you owe us from money you receive into your account, or money you attempt to withdraw or send from your account, or in a different account, and by deducting funds from any withdrawals you attempt to make.\nIf, for a period of 21 Days, you have a PayPal balance that reflects an amount owing to us that is not in Euros, we may convert the amount you owe us to Euros.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.\nYou are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that we determine is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nWe may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.\n<\/p>How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\n<\/p>\n<p> The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).\n<\/p>\n<p> We may make a transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) available for your review during your transaction.\nIf you complete the transaction, that transaction exchange rate may apply to the payment for the transaction whenever it is processed.\nor that rate may be valid only if the payment for that transaction is processed within a limited time, as stated during the transaction.\nAfter that limited time, we may use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the transaction is processed, or not perform the currency conversion.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you have authorised a payment under a billing agreement, and we perform currency conversion for that payment, we will use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the payment transaction is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment under a billing agreement may vary.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may provide you access to a “Currency Converter” tool to see what transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) may apply for certain currency conversions.\nAny rates shown using the Currency Converter tool only apply at the time you use the tool and are subject to change.<\/p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorise us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\n<\/p>\n<p> You may have the right to have your card issuer convert the currency of the card payment into the currency in which you send the payment from your PayPal account, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether we or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.\n<\/p>\n<p> PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use existing balance or your linked bank account is the funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p> If PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup funding source to be chosen, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on the payment from your backup funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p> Where a currency conversion is offered at the point of sale by the merchant, not by PayPal, and you choose to authorise the payment transaction on the basis of the merchant's exchange rate and charges, PayPal has no liability to you for that currency conversion.\n<\/p> Account Statements and Requesting Account Records <p>Unless your Account is restricted you may view and download your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou agree to review your transactions through your PayPal account history instead of receiving periodic statements by email.\n<\/p>\n<p>Key information relating to your payments will be provided to you via e-mail and your transaction history will also be updated and made available to you at any time by logging into your account.\nYou can also access a downloadable report from your PayPal account.\nThis will show all fees incurred and any other amounts charged to your PayPal account in the relevant period.\nThe report will only be updated and made available if there has been any activity on your PayPal account or any fees have been incurred in the relevant period.\nThe way in which we provide the transaction information will allow you to store and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy.\n<\/p>\n<p> We reserve the right to charge a fee for providing you with additional information or for providing the transaction history and other information about fees in a different way but we won’t charge you for records requested in connection with your good-faith assertion of an error in your PayPal account.<\/p> Fees <p> We charge fees for our services as set out on the fees page.\n<\/p>\n<p> Quoted fees are inclusive of all applicable taxes.\nhowever, other taxes or costs may exist that are not paid through or imposed by us.\n<\/p>\n<p> You are liable for telephone charges and any charges made by your internet service provider or similar or associated charges as a result of the use by you of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may deduct our fees from your PayPal balance.\nWe may deduct our transaction-related fees from the amounts we transfer before those funds are credited to your PayPal balance.\n<\/p>\n<p> We will provide you with the details of the amounts you receive and our fees charged either by e-mail or in your transaction history (which you can access by logging into your account).\n<\/p>\n<p> If your payment requires you to pay a fee to us, we may disclose that fee to you when you provide your payment instruction to us.\n<\/p>\n<p> You cannot set off or deduct any amounts from our fees.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may make a charge for any additional services we provide outside this user agreement.\nWe will tell you of those charges when you ask for the service.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a merchant and you wish to apply for (and retain) our volume-based tiered merchant rate, the terms of the merchant rate in the Receiving Payments section below apply.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nMaking A Payment General provisions for making a payment Your payment instruction <p>We may allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in any way which we may notify to you from time to time.\nThe way in which you provide your payment instruction can depend on the type of payment you are making – for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are paying for a purchase or making a donation, many sellers and/or fund collectors allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in a dedicated PayPal checkout or other PayPal payment collection integration on their site.<\/li>\n<li>You can use the “Send Money” feature when you log into your PayPal account to send a payment to someone.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> We may require you to authenticate your instruction (i.e.\ngive us the information that we need to be sure that it’s you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information – this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your payment instruction.\n<\/p> Cancelling your payment instruction <p> Once you provide you payment instruction to us, you may not cancel it, except if it is a payment instruction under a billing agreement (see below for more details).\n<\/p> How long will my payment take? <p>Your payment to another user will leave your account [within the Business Day] after we receive your complete payment instruction.<\/p>\n<p>The payment will leave your account within two Business Days if we receive your complete payment instruction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>on a day which is not a Business Day.\nor<\/li>\n<li>after the following local cut off times on a Business Day for accounts registered in the following countries: 4pm in Netherlands.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may allow you to ask us to make your payment on a specific later date, in which case your payment will leave your account on that later date.<\/p>\n<p>Other provisions in this user agreement may cause the above timeframes to be extended.<\/p>When we may refuse to make your payment <p>We may treat your payment instruction as not complete and we may refuse to make your payment if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you do not have enough money in your PayPal balance.\n<\/li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that your linked funding sources do not have sufficient funds to cover the money required to make your payment;<\/li>\n<li>you do not provide us with all mandatory information requested in the relevant payment or checkout flows which we use to obtain your payment instructions (for instance, sufficient details of the recipient as we may request and authentication of your payment instruction);<\/li>\n<li>the payment exceeds the sending limit we tell you about when you try to make the payment.\nor<\/li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that a restricted activity has happened in relation to your account or you are otherwise in breach of this user agreement.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> When your payment is not accepted by the recipient <p> If we allow you to send a payment to someone who does not have a PayPal account, the recipient can claim the money by opening a PayPal account.\n<\/p>\n<p> If the recipient already has a PayPal account, they can refuse to accept the money.\n<\/p>\n<p> If the recipient refuses to accept the money or doesn’t open a PayPal account and claim the money within 30 days after the date it is sent, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to your PayPal account.\nSee Refunds to your account for what can happen when your PayPal account receives a refund.\n<\/p> Sending limits <p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can make, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nTo lift your sending limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).<\/p> Setting up automatic charges from your account Seller delayed payments <p> When you pay certain sellers or pay for certain purchases (for instance, purchases which have to be shipped to you or may be updated and finalised by the seller), you are providing: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an authorisation to the seller to collect your payment at a later time.\nand<\/li>\n<li>an instruction to us to automatically pay that seller when the seller requests payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> Your authorisation will typically remain valid for up to 30 days, but may remain valid for longer.\nIf you have balance, we may hold the payment amount as pending until the seller collects your payment.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied (as described in the Currency Conversion section) at the time the payment is processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> Your authorisation allows the seller to update the payment amount before the seller collects the payment (to account for any changes to the purchase that you may agree with the seller, such as additional taxes, shipping or postage charges or discounts).\nWe are not required to verify any changes at any time (including at the time the payment is transferred).\nWe may transfer any amount on the basis of your authorisation and upon receiving instructions from the seller of the final payment amount.\n<\/p> Billing agreement payments <p> You can use a billing agreement to manage payments to the same recipient(s) on an ongoing automatic basis.\nWhen you enter into a billing agreement:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>you authorise the named recipient(s) to collect payments from your account as the recipient determines (this could be for payments of amounts you owe the recipient for a purchase of goods or services under a separate contract that you have with the recipient).\nand<\/li>\n<li>you instruct PayPal to pay the named recipient(s) (or other recipient(s) that the named recipient(s) direct(s)) when the named recipient(s) request(s) PayPal to make your payment.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This makes the recipient a “trusted beneficiary” (the legal term for someone you tell us is a trusted recipient) of all your payments made under that billing agreement, so we will not normally ask you to authenticate (e.g.\nlog in) or approve these payments when they are made.\n<\/p>\n<p> Payments made under the billing agreement may be in variable amounts and may be made on various dates.\nWe are only a payment service provider so we can’t (and please don’t expect us to) know what you have or haven’t agreed with the recipient or to know why the recipient decided to collect your payment.\nWe are not obliged to verify or confirm the amount the recipient presents to us for the purpose of processing payments made under the billing agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> We use several names for payments that can be managed by a billing agreement – these include “automatic payments,” \"subscription payments\" \"recurring payments” “reference transactions” \"preauthorised transfers\" or \"preapproved payment.\" <\/p>\n<p> You can cancel your billing agreement at any time with immediate effect in your account interface or by contacting us.\nWhere a payment under that billing agreement is scheduled to be made before the end of the next Business Day after you tell us to cancel it, we may cancel your billing agreement after that payment has been made.\nIf you cancel a billing agreement, you may still owe the recipient money for goods or services that you have received but have not paid for.\n<\/p>\n<p> If we determine currency conversion is necessary for a billing agreement payment, and we perform the conversion, we will use the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the payment is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment transaction may vary.\n<\/p> Refunds to your account How refunds can happen <p> We may allow the recipient of your payment to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>refuse to accept it.\nor<\/li>\n<li>decide to accept it and then use our service to send you a refund of all or any part of the amount of the payment later.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> We will return the amount of any refused payment or refunded payment to your Balance.\nWe will return the amount of an unclaimed payment to your balance within 30 days after the date you initiated the payment.\nIf any amount of any payment is returned to you in any of the ways outlined above, we may convert the returned amount for you into either: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the currency of the balance you used for the original payment (before any conversion into the currency received by the recipient happened);<\/li>\n<li>the opening currency of your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>US dollars (opening a balance in that currency for you, if you don’t have one already).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the original payment you sent involved a currency conversion we will convert the returned amount from the currency received by the recipient as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the amount is returned within 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable on the date of the original payment, so that you receive the original amount (including the currency conversion fee you paid) in the original currency you converted for the original payment.\nand<\/li>\n<li>if the amount is returned after 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of the conversion of the returned amount.\nYou agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Unless otherwise outlined above in this section, you agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments when you convert any amount returned to you in the ways outlined above.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may also automatically withdraw the returned amount from your Balance and transfer the funds back to the funding source you used for the original payment.\nWithdrawals can also involve a currency conversion – see the section on Withdrawing money above.\n<\/p>Risks when receiving refunds <p> The returned amount could be lower in value than your original payment amount.\nThis can happen as a result of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the recipient sending you a refund lower in value than your original payment amount.\nAs we are only a payment service provider, we cannot know what you are entitled to from the original payment recipient as a refund or why the recipient sent the refund in a particular amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>transaction exchange rate fluctuations.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal is not responsible for any loss resulting from the recipient's decision to refuse or refund your payment, except to the extent that a refund sent by the recipient is a payment executed incorrectly by PayPal <\/p>\n<p>We are not liable to you for the difference between the value of your original payment and the value of the resulting refund, except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).\n<\/p> Funding Your Payment Selecting a preferred funding source <p>You may select a preferred funding source when logged into your account.\nSubject to this user agreement, the preferred funding source will be used as the default funding source for payments you send from your account.<\/p>\n<p> You can set separate preferred funding sources for some billing agreement payments.\n<\/p> Special Funding Arrangements <p> Some payments can be funded by special funding arrangements linked to your PayPal account, such as merchant/transaction specific balance, gift vouchers or other promotional funding arrangements.\nThe use and priority of these special funding arrangements are subject to further terms and conditions between you and us.\nYour account overview may show the notional amount available in your special funding arrangements to fund qualifying payments at any given time.\nThis amount does not constitute electronic money, is not deemed part of your PayPal balance and is not redeemable in cash - it only represents the amount of electronic money which we offer to issue and credit to your account at the time of (and only to immediately fund) a qualifying payment, subject to (and only for the period outlined in) the further terms and conditions of use of that special funding arrangement.\nIf your payment funded by a special funding arrangement is reversed at a later time for any reason, we will keep the amount that represents the portion of that payment that was funded by your special funding arrangement and (provided that the special funding arrangement has not already expired) reinstate the special funding arrangement.<\/p> Funding payments you send from your account <p> We will obtain electronic money for the payment you send from your account from the following sources in the following order to the extent they are available:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Special Funding Arrangements (if available for the given transaction)<\/li>\n<li>Preferred funding source (if selected and available)<\/li>\n<li>Pre-existing PayPal balance<\/li>\n<li>Bank account (instant transfer via bank mandate)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal Credit (where available)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal-branded debit card (where available)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal-branded credit card (where available)<\/li>\n<li>Debit card<\/li>\n<li>Credit card<\/li>\n<li>Bank account (eCheque) <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you have linked a bank account as a funding source we may choose to offer you access to Pay After Delivery, which allows you to defer a charge to this bank account for a period of time.\nIf you are offered and choose to use this service, the Pay After Delivery Terms will apply.<\/p> PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection.\nWhen applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection.\nPayPal’s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn’t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn’t what you ordered (referred to as a “Significantly Not as Described” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the PayPal Buyer Protection, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.<\/p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection.<\/p>Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>\n<strong>will not<\/strong>\n<\/em> qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not Received claim, if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller’s retail point of sale, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions or<\/li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller’s description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as “new” but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn’t receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as “used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal Buyer Protection <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats, except for personally portable light vehicles used for recreational purposes like bicycles and wheeled hoverboards.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms, as well as payments made on crowdlending platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>For

for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made in respect of gold (whether in physical form or in exchange-traded form).<\/li>\n<\/ul> Transaction eligibility for PayPal Buyer Protection <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, then follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery related to such purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you’re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the&nbsp;<strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>&nbsp;to pursue a claim under our PayPal Buyer Protection.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within&nbsp;180 days&nbsp;of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal&nbsp;account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days&nbsp;after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nIf you are making an Item Not Received claim, PayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.<\/p>\n<p>Step 3:&nbsp;<strong>Respond to PayPal’s requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4:&nbsp;<strong>Comply with PayPal’s shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you’re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item&nbsp;back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide Proof of Delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Step 5:&nbsp;<strong>PayPal will make a final decision&nbsp;<\/strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p> Event tickets <p>In certain cases, if you purchase a ticket or pay for the right to attend an event from a payment recipient who is a UK registered PayPal account holder (“Event”), all monies paid by you may be held by PayPal on trust for you, so that the beneficial interest in such monies remains with you until the performance of the Event in question.<\/p>Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal’s Buyer Protection.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don’t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our PayPal Buyer Protection, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can’t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we’ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won’t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).<\/p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller’s return policy.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nReceiving Payments General provisions for receiving payments <p>PayPal may allow anybody (with or without an account) to make a payment resulting in the issuance or transfer of electronic money to your account.\n<\/p>\n<p>By integrating (including by having already integrated) into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>The receipt of a payment into your account does not equate to the receipt of cleared funds.\nA notification that a payment has been sent to you does not amount to a receipt of electronic money in your account unless you have accepted the payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may allow you to accept payments in any currency supported by our Service from time to time.\n<\/p>\n<p>Where you (instead of PayPal) offer the payer at the point of sale a currency conversion of an amount you receive through PayPal, you will inform the buyer of the exchange rate and any charges that will be applied to the payment transaction.\nPayPal has no liability to any buyer if you fail to inform the buyer of the exchange rate and charges.\nYou acknowledge that if you fail to disclose the exchange rate and charges to the buyer this may constitute a criminal offence by you.<\/p>\n<p>Any payment sent to you may be subject to a reversal, payment review, limitation, reserve or hold as allowed under this user agreement.\n<\/p>Receiving limits <p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can receive, including money you receive for purchases.\nTo lift your receiving limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).<\/p>\n<strong>New checkout solution included in the PayPal Commerce Platform<\/strong>\n<p>The PayPal Commerce Platform includes our new checkout solution.&nbsp.\nThe checkout solution consists of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>our dedicated bundled checkout capability in your online checkout/platform to enable a buyer with or without an account to send a payment to your account.\nand<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fraud Protection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may offer you all, any part or any combination of parts of the checkout solution.\nIf we offer you the checkout solution and you choose to use it, in addition to this user agreement, you agree to the following further terms relating to the following capabilities:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement<\/strong>, when you use our APM functionality as part of the checkout solution.\nand<\/li>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Online Card Payment Services Agreement<\/strong>, when you use: <ul>\n<li>our Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments as part of the checkout solution bundle.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Fraud Protection as part of the checkout solution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Our <strong>Fees<\/strong>&nbsp;for using the checkout solution apply.<\/p> Rules about surcharging <p>PayPal does not encourage surcharging because it is a commercial practice that can penalise the consumer and create unnecessary confusion, friction and abandonment at checkout.\n<\/p>\n<p>You may only surcharge for the use of our services in compliance with any law applicable to you and not in excess of the surcharges that you apply for the use of other payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>If you surcharge a buyer, you, and not we, will inform the buyer of the requested charge.\nWe are not liable to any buyer where you have failed to inform the buyer of any surcharge.\nYou acknowledge that you could be committing a criminal offence if you surcharge and/or fail to disclose any form of surcharge to a buyer.<\/p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal as a payment method or mark at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or substantially similar:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>logo placement,<\/li>\n<li>position within any point of sale,<\/li>\n<li>treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, or fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterise PayPal as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal.<\/p> Taxes and information reporting <p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nWe are not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.\nAs a bank service provider no sales tax applies to the PayPal services in the EU.<\/p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy.<\/p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace’s or the third party application’s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p>\n<p>We may allow you to authorise certain marketplaces to use your account to pay amounts you owe to the marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) arising from a claim under the terms of the marketplace’s own resolution process (“<strong>Marketplace Due Amounts<\/strong>”).\nIf you give such an authorisation and the marketplace notifies us of the claim, you instruct us to process payments of all and any Marketplace Due Amounts relating to that claim from your PayPal account to that marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) according to the marketplace’s instructions to us.\nWe may treat your instruction for the payment of any given Marketplace Due Amount as cancelled if we decide that the claim would have been determined in your favour had it been filed as a claim with us.\nYou can also cancel this instruction by contacting us.\nAll claims filed directly with the marketplace are governed by the marketplace’s own policy only.\nThe terms of the PayPal Seller Protection Programme do not cover you for claims filed by your buyers directly with the marketplace.<\/p> Accepting billing agreement payments <p>If we allow you to accept payments from a payer under a billing agreement, when you present to us a payment request under that billing agreement, you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>warrant to us that the amounts you present have been agreed and consented to by the payer whose account will be deducted (including changes to those amounts) and that you will give prior notice of the deduction to the payer.\nand<\/li>\n<li>agree that you will notify the payer at least 4 weeks in advance of the amount they will collect if that amount has increased in such a manner that the payer could not have reasonably expected to pay such an amount, taking into account the payer’s previous spending patterns and the circumstances of the payment and that you are liable to us for any refunds of that payment in accordance with the terms of this user agreement.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Refunds and reversals of payments <p>When you receive a payment, it could be refunded or reversed.\nWe may allow you to send to the payer a refund of the payment.\nWe may carry out a reversal of your payment in certain circumstances.\nSee the rest of this section for more details.<\/p>Refunds <p>You alone are (and PayPal is not) responsible for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>your legal and contractual obligations towards the payer for any amount you return to the payer.\nand<\/li>\n<li>any difference between the cost to the payer of making the original payment and the value of the amount returned to the payer (for instance, as a result of transaction exchange rate fluctuations) except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).<br>\n<br>See our fees for details of the fees you paid to us as the recipient of the original payment which we retain when you use the special commercial transaction refund functionality in your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nexcept to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).<\/li>\n<\/ul>Reversals <p>If you receive a payment in your account, you owe us the full amount of the payment and our losses arising from processing the payment.\nThis can include our liability (including any fees, charges and penalties) towards any third party (including the payer and the payer’s funding source provider).<\/p>\n<p>A reversal happens when we exercise our right to set off the above amounts from your account under the section Reimbursement for your liability in this user agreement.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount you owe us in that currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall and you will be charged for the currency conversion.\nThis means that, for example, if you are a seller, amounts of payments received in your account may be removed from your account after you have delivered any goods or services sold.<\/p>\n<p>A reversal can happen when:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we reimburse the payer in respect of a PayPal Buyer Protection claim the payer made against you.<\/li>\n<li>we compensate the payer or the payer’s funding source provider (or both) because we receive a claim from the payer or their funding source provider for the payment amount under the reversal process used by that funding source provider.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For instance:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the payer used a card to fund the payment to you the payer could pursue a “chargeback” with the card issuer.\nThe card issuer, not us, determines whether the payer is successful when they pursue a chargeback.\nYou can find out more about chargebacks by reviewing our Chargeback Guide, accessible via the PayPal Security Centre and the section called: “Selling Safely”.\nThe PayPal Security Centre is accessed via the PayPal website.\nWe charge you a fee for receiving a chargeback claim.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If the payer used a bank account to fund the payment the payer or the bank could pursue a bank reversal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The amount claimed may be greater than the original amount you received due to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the time of payment and the time of the claim.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we may have to compensate your payer when they claimed that there was a problem with their payment (including that their payment was unauthorised or incorrect or that their billing agreement payment was not expected) – see Resolving Problems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>we are entitled to carry out the reversal for any other reason under this user agreement, including the provision Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Impact of PayPal Buyer Protection on sellers <p> You should read our Buyer Protection Policy and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection made available by PayPal to buyers in each of those countries as buyers’ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about the PayPal Buyer Protection on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer’s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding PayPal Buyer Protection listed on that page or in the corresponding user agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under&nbsp;PayPal Buyer Protection&nbsp.\nin any country:<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back plus pay for return shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/p>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay’s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your cash account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nplace a&nbsp;hold&nbsp;on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor<\/p>\n<p>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/p> PayPal Seller Protection What’s eligible <p>If you have received more than €100,000 per month at least once over a consecutive period of 6 months on your PayPal Account and/or if you are applying surcharge for the use of PayPal (when the law applicable to you allows you to apply surcharge), you are not eligible for PayPal seller protection and this section applies to you unless otherwise agreed between you and PayPal.\nPayPal will review your eligibility for seller protection in October and April of each calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks,&nbsp;you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Seller Protection.\nWhen it applies, PayPal Seller Protection entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program<\/p>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an “Unauthorized Transaction” claim) and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They didn’t receive the item from you (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal Seller Protection as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various PayPal Buyer protection processes on sellers.<\/p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the Netherlands.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for items subject to the&nbsp;<strong>Intangible Goods Additional Requirements<\/strong>.\nTransactions involving items that you deliver in person in connection with payment made in your physical store, may also be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection so long as the buyer paid for the transaction in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person, provided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the&nbsp;<strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.&nbsp;If you do not respond to PayPal’s request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>Provide proof of shipment or delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The payment must be marked \"eligible\" or \"partially eligible\" in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims for PayPal Seller Protection on the \"Transaction Details\" page.<\/li>\n<li>You must accept a single payment from one PayPal Account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Seller Protection program.\nPayPal will make a decision, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements, any information or documentation provided during the resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>Item Not Received additional requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection program for a buyer’s Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements&nbsp.\nlisted above and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked “eligible” for PayPal’s Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements<\/li>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third party or if you have a native app integration.<\/li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.<\/li>\n<li>If the transaction is a payment for digital goods or licenses for digital content, you must have paid Standard Transaction Fees on the sale (this does not apply to payments for other Intangible Goods).<\/li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of delivery for Intangible Goods.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as:<\/p>\n<p>Proof of shipment<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery<\/p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the Transaction Details page, or<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of delivery and ‘delivered’ status<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the Transaction Details page<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city/state, city/country, or zip/postal code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<li>Signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the&nbsp;<strong>signature confirmation threshold table<\/strong>.\nSignature confirmation is online documentation, viewable at the shipping company’s website, indicating that the item was signed for.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> Your choice of carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.\nPlease ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide ‘delivered’ status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of delivery for intangible goods:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>QR Code Transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of shipment or proof of delivery:<\/p>\n<p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.\nCompelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Received or accessed by the recipient<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For QR code transactions you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information to the

generally.<\/p> Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities <p>If we believe that you’ve engaged in any of these activities, we may take a number of actions to protect PayPal, its customers and others at any time in our sole discretion.&nbsp.\nThe actions we may take include, but are not limited to, the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terminate this user agreement, limit your account, and/or close or suspend your account, immediately and without penalty to us;<\/li>\n<li>Refuse to provide the PayPal services to you in the future;<\/li>\n<li>At any time and without liability, suspend, limit or terminate your access to our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, your PayPal account or any of the PayPal services, including limiting your ability to pay or send money with any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account, restricting your ability to send money or make withdrawals;<\/li>\n<li>Hold your money to the extent and for so long as reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability.\nYou acknowledge that, as a non-exhaustive guide:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>PayPal’s risk of liability in respect of card-funded payments that you receive can last until the risk of a chargeback closing in favour of the payer/buyer (as determined by card scheme rules) has passed.\nThis depends on certain factors, including, without limitation: <ul>\n<li>a.\nThe type of goods or services for which you receive payment.\nor<\/li>\n<li>b.\nThe timeframe for delivery of the goods or performance of the services for which you receive payment (e.g.\nsales of event tickets months in advance of the event date can present a higher and more enduring risk of chargebacks than sales of most other items or services);<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>PayPal’s risk of liability in respect of a claim or dispute arising from a payment that you receive can last for the time that it takes for the parties to close the claim or dispute and all appeals associated with that claim or dispute in accordance with PayPal Buyer Protection<\/li>\n<li>PayPal’s risk of liability in respect of any event of insolvency that you suffer can last for as long as and to the extent that laws applicable to your insolvency restrict PayPal from taking legal action against you.\nand<\/li>\n<li>If you allow your PayPal account to have a balance reflecting an amount owing to PayPal, PayPal’s risk of liability can last for the time and to the extent that you owe that amount to PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Block your PayPal account and/or hold any funds in the reserve account (including, without limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by PayPal, where PayPal’s rights arise from your engagement in the restricted activity);<\/li>\n<li>Refuse any particular payment transaction at any time for any reason and will only be required to make available the fact of the refusal and the reasons for the refusal and how you may resolve the problem, where possible, upon request and provided it is not prohibited by law;<\/li>\n<li>Reverse <strong>a payment<\/strong>&nbsp;(including, if appropriate, to the sender’s funding source);<\/li>\n<li>Take legal action against you.<\/li>\n<li>Suspend your eligibility for

violation of this policy,<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account primarily for the purposes of your trade, business, craft or profession and you violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal's damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>you acknowledge and agree that USD 2,500.00 (or the prevailing equivalent in the currency of the country in which you reside) per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is: <ul>\n<li>a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated;<\/li>\n<li>reasonable and proportionate in its application to the provision of the Services to you.\nand<\/li>\n<li>necessary, but no more than sufficient, to protect PayPal’s legitimate interest in your compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy.\nand<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please also see the section below on <u>Your liability<\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>Unless otherwise directed by us, you must not use or attempt to use your account while it is suspended or has been closed.\nYou must ensure that all agreements with sellers or other third parties that involve third party initiated payments (including billing agreement payments) set up from your account are cancelled immediately upon the termination, suspension or closure of your account.\nYou remain liable under this user agreement in respect of all charges and other amounts incurred through the use of your account at any time, irrespective of termination, suspension or closure.<\/p> Holds, Limitations, and Reserves What are holds, limitations and reserves? <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nIf we take any of the actions described here, we will normally notify you of our actions, but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example if you are in breach of this user agreement or we consider it advisable for security reasons), take any of these actions without prior notice to you.<\/p>\n<p>To request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that any funds held under this user agreement may be placed in your reserve account and that you will provide to us any information as we may reasonably request to allow us to determine whether the risk has passed.<\/p>Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.&nbsp.\nWhen PayPal places a hold on a payment amount, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\n&nbsp;PayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include where we have reason to believe that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transactions are higher risk, this can be where the transaction involves the sale of goods or services in a high risk category, or other facts known to us typically resulting in an increased number of chargebacks, other claims or disputes or to be often involved in fraud or illegal activity;<\/li>\n<li>There is a sudden and abnormal change in a PayPal account holder’s selling activity including an increase in the number of chargebacks, reversals, or buyer complaints received in relation to such PayPal account;<\/li>\n<li>Any PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities;<\/li>\n<li>A PayPal account involved in the transaction may have been compromised, or that stolen financial details (bank or credit card) are used for the payment, or otherwise a transaction has not been properly authorised;<\/li>\n<li>A user is trying to send or withdraw funds they received fraudulently;<\/li>\n<li>A user has not provided sufficient Information to us to enable us to verify their identity or the identity of their business and/or the user has a limited trading history with PayPal;<\/li>\n<li>A payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer files a chargeback, reversal or PayPal Buyer Protection claim on a payment you received.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer files a claim under a marketplace's resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of reversal of funds in your account to your funding source.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).<\/li>\n<\/ul>Payment review <p>When we identify a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nThis may be because we have the reasonable suspicion that the payer’s PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities or for other reasons as determined by us in our reasonable discretion.&nbsp.\nThis may include where there is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).<\/p>\n<p>If a payment is subject to payment review, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>execute the payment order initiated by the buyer;<\/li>\n<li>in our discretion, immediately upon such execution restrict the payer’s account;<\/li>\n<li>place a hold on the payment [in the payer’s account].\nand/or<\/li>\n<li>notify the recipient to delay the delivery of the purchase paid for by the payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If we don’t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\n<p>All payments that complete payment review are still subject to being reversed under the terms of this user agreement but will be Seller Protection eligible if they meet the Seller Protection requirements.\nPayPal will provide notices to you by email and/or in the transaction history tab of your PayPal account.\nA payment subject to payment review is a review of the payment only and is implemented to reduce the risk of PayPal users receiving high risk transactions.\nA payment subject to payment review is neither a review nor a representation by PayPal as to the commercial dealings, character or reputation of a party to the payment transaction and should not be considered as a lessening of the respect of any person.<\/p>Holds related to your instructions <p>Certain PayPal functionality may allow you (whether directly or via someone you permit to act on your behalf, like an online marketplace platform on which you transact as a seller) to instruct us to hold your funds (including the proceeds of payments you receive using PayPal) in your reserve account.<\/p>\n<p>In such a case we will show you the availability status of those funds in your balance – the status descriptions may differ according to the functionality you used to instruct us to place the hold.\nWe will release the hold on the funds according to the instruction that you (or the entity that you have permitted to act on your behalf) give to us, subject to the rest of this user agreement.<\/p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice&nbsp;<strong>restricted activities<\/strong>, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.&nbsp.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including where we have reason to believe that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, then we’ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>Someone has used your card or bank account without your permission, for example if your debit or credit card issuer or bank alerts us to this.<\/li>\n<li>You have breached this user agreement or violated the&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>Your performance as a seller indicate your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you’ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities&nbsp;above).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also limit your PayPal account in order to comply with applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>Reserves <p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.&nbsp.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the funds in your PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A “rolling reserve”<\/strong>&nbsp;is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A “minimum reserve”<\/strong>&nbsp;is a specific minimum amount of funds that you’re required to keep available in your balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your PayPal account, the money will be moved to your reserve account and shown as “pending” and we’ll notify you about it.<\/p>\n<p>If we change the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you about it as well.<\/p>\n<p>You will undertake, at your own expense, any further action required to establish a reserve or other form of security in a manner reasonably determined by us.&nbsp.\nThis can involve executing any necessary documents and registering any form of document reasonably required by us to allow us to perfect any form of security interest.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nRESOLVING PROBLEMS <strong>\n<p>We strongly recommend that you monitor your account closely on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<\/strong> If you find a problem… <p>If you have any reason to believe that there is a problem with your account or our service, follow these steps:<\/p> Step 1: Take a few moments to identify the type of problem: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Unexpected billing agreement payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where you entered into a billing agreement but a payment was sent from your account to another PayPal account under that billing agreement where:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you didn’t agree with the recipient in advance the exact payment amount.\nand<\/li>\n<li>the payment amount ended up being more than you could reasonably have expected to pay based on previous charges and the other circumstances.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Incorrect payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where a payment sent from your account to another PayPal account was not sent as you specified when you asked us to make it (e.g.\nfor the wrong amount, delayed, wrong recipient) or you received such a payment.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Security / Fraud problem<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Unauthorised payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where a payment sent from your account wasn’t authorised by you (or anyone who’s authorised to make payments for you).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Another type of security / fraud problem<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where there was another security or fraud problem, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>there was some other unauthorised access to your account.<\/li>\n<li>your password or PIN was compromised.<\/li>\n<li>a device you have used to access our services was lost, stolen or deactivated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<br>\n<p>Follow the steps in the section “<strong>What to do in case of a security problem<\/strong>” in the <strong>\n<u>Key Payment and Service Information<\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;as soon as possible before contacting us.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Another type of problem <\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where there was another type of problem with your account or with our service which is not mentioned above.\nFor instance, we may have made a factual, computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal when you added money to or withdrew money from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If a purchase that you paid for with PayPal was not as described or you have not received the purchase, the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy, not this section, may apply.&nbsp.\nPlease see the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy&nbsp;for how to deal with these particular

are contacting us about so that we can help you as quickly as we can).<\/p>\n<p>You must give us all the information we reasonably request as to the circumstances of the problem and take all reasonable steps we request to assist us in our investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If you tell us about your problem orally, we may require that you report your problem in writing within 10&nbsp;<strong>Business Days<\/strong> after that.<\/p>\n<p>We may provide third parties with information we consider relevant in such circumstances in accordance with our <strong>\n<u>Privacy Policy<\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;(alternatively known as our Privacy Statement).<\/p> How we will help...\n<p>Subject to the rest of this user agreement, we aim to investigate the problem and work with you to resolve it within 60 days.\nIn addition, if your problem is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an unexpected billing agreement payment, <\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;within 10 Business Days after telling us about it we will either: <ul>\n<li>reimburse you for the payment amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>explain why we cannot reimburse you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an incorrect payment to another Paypal account, <\/u>\n<\/strong>we will:<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>make immediate efforts to trace the payment and notify you of the outcome without charge to you;<\/li>\n<li>compensate you as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) by putting your account in the state it would have been in had the incorrect payment been sent as actually specified by the sender.\nThis means: <ul>\n<li>If the incorrect payment resulted in you having less money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we will credit your account for the difference.<\/li>\n<li>If the incorrect payment resulted in you having more money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we may debit the extra funds from your&nbsp;account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>reimburse you in your account for your losses or damages directly and reasonably foreseeably caused by the incorrect payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an unauthorised payment to another PayPal account, <\/u>\n<\/strong>as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) we will put your account back to where it would have been had the payment never happened.&nbsp.\nThis can include a <u>reimbursement<\/u> of your payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul> When we can’t compensate you...\n<p>You are not entitled to any financial compensation from us as outlined above and you will owe to us (and we may reverse from your account) any compensation you have already received from us if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You do not give us all the information we reasonably requested as to the circumstances of the problem (including, if you tell us about your problem orally, you fail to comply with our request that you tell us about your problem in writing within 10&nbsp;<strong>Business Days<\/strong>);<\/li>\n<li>You do not take all reasonable steps that we request to assist us in our investigation;<\/li>\n<li>We can show that you acted fraudulently;<\/li>\n<li>We can show that circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood or loss of internet connection) caused the problem, despite our reasonable precautions;<\/li>\n<li>We have reason to believe otherwise that there is no problem which entitles you to compensation.\nor<\/li>\n<li>In respect of the following specific problems:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Unexpected billing agreement payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Incorrect payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Unauthorised payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 8 weeks after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>You agreed for us to make your payment and the details were made available to you by us or the merchant at least 4 weeks before the payment was made.<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that you gave us the wrong payment details.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that the payment was sent as the payer specified when the payer asked us to make it.\nor<\/p>\n<p>Through no fault of ours, you did not have enough PayPal balance to complete the payment.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/p>\n<p>A delay which you claimed caused the incorrect payment actually resulted from PayPal applying&nbsp;a <strong>hold, limitation or reserve <\/strong>\n<strong>under this user agreement<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that the payment was made because you did not keep your account safe either intentionally or with gross negligence (for instance, you very carelessly chose to share your PayPal ID and/or password/PIN with someone else).\nor<\/p>\n<p>There was <strong>another security /fraud problem<\/strong> and you didn’t tell us about it.\nWe will not pay you compensation for any unauthorised payments made from your account before you told us about that problem.\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes we might spot the problem first.&nbsp.\nIf we need to notify you about the problem, we will ordinarily do so through the Secure Messaging Centre, which you need to log into your account to access.\nIf you should take action urgently, we may also use other means such as email to request action.<\/p>\n<p>If a payment was made from us to your funding source by way of mistake, we may correct the mistake by debiting or crediting (as the case may be) your appropriate funding source(s).<\/p> Complaints Reporting disputes between you and PayPal regarding our services<p>Contact us&nbsp;to report disputes between you and PayPal regarding our services.<\/p>\n<p>If a dispute

agreement will be effective for all users as of October 31, 2020.<\/p> Welcome to PayPal! <p>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal Pte.\nLtd., a Singaporean company governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nIf you are an individual, you must be a resident of one of the countries/regions listed on the <strong>PayPal Worldwide<\/strong> page and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your country/region of residence to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of one of the countries/regions listed on the <strong>PayPal Worldwide<\/strong> page to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nYou also agree to comply with the following additional policies and each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>Alternative Payment Methods Terms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, the terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may amend this user agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it on our website, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you with at least 14 days notice.\nAll future changes set out in the Policy Updates page already published on the Legal Agreements page at the time you register for the PayPal services are incorporated by reference into this user agreement and will take effect as specified in the Policy Update.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not agree to the revised terms and conditions, you must stop using the PayPal services, close your account and terminate your relationship with us without cost or penalty.\nThis user agreement will continue to apply to your previous use of our services.<\/p> About our main business <p>PayPal is a payment services provider and acts as such by creating, hosting, maintaining and providing our PayPal services to you via the internet.\nOur services allow you to send payments to anyone with a PayPal account, and, where available, to receive payments.\nOur service availability varies by country/region.\nYou can see what services are available in your country/region by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>The PayPal services are offered by PayPal Pte.\nLtd.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consumer Advisory — PayPal Pte.\nLtd., the holder of the PayPal stored value facility, does not require the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\nConsumers (users) are advised to read the terms and conditions carefully.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement is not a solicitation of the PayPal services and PayPal is not targeting any country/region or market through this user agreement.<\/p> Opening an Account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.<\/p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive payments.<\/li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.<\/li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods.<\/li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods from others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>In order to open and maintain a PayPal account, you must list your correct country/region of residence and provide us with correct and updated account information, including but not limited to personal information, financial information, or other information related to you or your business.<\/p>\n<p>You must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p> Personal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send payments to family and friends, a personal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal account you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy goods and services.<\/li>\n<li>Send and request payments from friends and family.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>You can also use a personal account to receive payments for the sale of goods and services, but if you plan to use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should consider a business account.\nYou can convert your PayPal account from a personal account to a business account should circumstances change.<\/p> Business accounts <p>We recommend business accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business account, you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening, when you request certain new products and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business account.<\/strong>\n<\/p> Commercial Entity Agreement <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.<\/p> Third Party permissions <p>You must be the beneficial owner of your PayPal account, and conduct business only on behalf of yourself.<\/p>\n<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.\nIn some cases, you can do this when logged into your PayPal account – in other cases, you can do this directly with the third party.\nYou acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your PayPal account to this third party.<\/p>\n<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;<\/li>\n<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your PayPal account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.\nYou are liable to us for the actions that you authorize the third parties to carry out.\nYou will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost or penalty, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nYou must withdraw or transfer any PayPal balance from your PayPal account before closing it.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.\n<\/p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card or a bank account to your PayPal account as a payment method.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (i.e.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.<\/p> Holding a PayPal Balance <p>Any PayPal balance you hold represents an unsecured claim against PayPal.\nPayPal combines your balance with the balances of other users and invests those funds in liquid investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held separate from PayPal's corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.\nYou will not receive interest or other earnings on the amounts in your balance.\nYou agree PayPal shall own the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nYou agree to assign any rights to any interest derived from your funds to PayPal.<\/p> Adding or Withdrawing Funds Adding funds to your balance <p>You may use the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to fund transactions you make using your PayPal account.\nYou don't need a PayPal balance to buy something or send payments.\nYou can add funds your PayPal account from the bank account that's linked to your PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer to your PayPal account.\nThe amount transferred will be held as a balance in your PayPal account.\nCredit cards cannot be used to add funds to your PayPal balance.<\/p> Withdrawing funds from your balance <p>If you have a PayPal balance, log into your PayPal account to see which of these withdrawal options are available in your country/region:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it to a bank account linked to your PayPal account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>transferring it to your debit or credit card, where available.\nor<\/li>\n<li>requesting a physical cheque through the mail, where available.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on the country/region in which your account is registered, you may be able to withdraw your funds through a third party service provider.\nPlease see terms of such third party for information regarding currency conversions.<\/p>\n<p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or the negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit card or debit card information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may charge a fee to make a transfer to your bank account.\nIf your debit card is eligible to receive withdrawals from your PayPal account, you will be provided the option to use it when you transfer funds out of your PayPal balance, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for personal accounts) page and the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business accounts) page.\nThe applicable fees will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, we will send physical cheques through the mail only to confirmed addresses, unless we have verified your PayPal account.\nWe will not send cheques to post office boxes.\nIf you would like us to send a cheque to an address that does not meet these criteria, you must contact customer service and provide the documentation that we request to verify your association with the address.\nIf you fail to cash a cheque within 180 Days of the date of issuance, we will return the funds to your balance (minus a fee).<\/p> Managing Your Balance in Multiple Currencies Holding multiple currencies <p>Your PayPal balance may be held in any of the currencies supported by PayPal, and you may hold a balance in more than one of these currencies at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your PayPal account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the balance into another currency.\nIf you convert the balance in your account, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of your balance that you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.<\/li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the balance in the opening currency of your account or such other currency that PayPal supports for withdrawal in your registered country/region.\nIn order to withdraw the balance in your account which is held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate, including our currency conversion fee, will be used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To receive funds in a currency that your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your PayPal account in that currency or convert the balance into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in your PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.<\/p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).<\/p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe currency conversion fee applicable can be found on our fees page under the heading Currency conversion fees.<\/p>Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and involves a currency conversion by PayPal, you consent to and authorize us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis currency preference selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and the fees they may charge.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use your existing PayPal balance or your linked bank account is the payment method.<\/p> Account Statements Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSending payments and buying Sending payments to or Receiving payments from a Friend or Family Member Sending payments <p>In some countries/regions, you can send funds to a friend or family member from your PayPal account using the send payments feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called personal payments or peer-to-peer/P2P payments).\n<\/p>\n<p>Visit our Available Services by Country/Region of Residence list to see which services are available in your country/region of residence or log into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>You can send funds to a friend or family member even if they don't have a PayPal account at the time you send them funds, using their email address or mobile number, in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending funds does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't claim it, it will be refunded to you.\nReceiving funds from a friend or family member is described under <strong>Receiving Funds<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of funds you can send, including funds you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging in to your PayPal account.\nWe may increase your sending limits if you complete the same steps to verify your information as is required for the removal of withdrawal limits.<\/p>\n<p>When you send funds to a friend or family member, one of three things may happen: they may accept, decline or fail to claim the funds.\nIf they either decline to accept the funds or don't claim them within 30 days of the date they are sent, the funds (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal Credit as the payment method, or<\/li>\n<li>Your PayPal balance, if you used your PayPal balance as the payment method or a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Receiving payments <p>If a friend or family member sends funds to you, the funds will appear in your PayPal balance.\nTo receive funds in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the funds into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p> Fees for Sending payments to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending funds can be found in our Sending funds table and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send funds to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert your PayPal balance from one currency to another, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you send funds to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party's product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.<\/p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal in any currency that the seller accepts, and that PayPal supports, using the funds in your PayPal balance, or using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer's website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Sending a payment to a seller for good or services.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller's physical store.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.<\/p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third-party websites or applications, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>American Express may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as branded airlines and certain travel merchants;<\/li>\n<li>Some credit cards may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as those in the gambling industry.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Credit cards cannot be used to send personal payments or to top up your PayPal balance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied as described in the How we convert currency section and will be determined at the time the payment is processed.<\/p>\nFees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you don't pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>Your credit card or debit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for transactions.<\/p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don't clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\nAutomatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows the seller to take funds from your PayPal account with your authorization on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>You may cancel an automatic payment up to 3 Business Days before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the PayPal Help Centre.\nOnce an automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller funds for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for and you may be required to pay the seller through alternative means.<\/p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs a currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal's currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal balance.\nIf you used a bank account as the payment method for the transaction, we will refund the payment to your bank account, or to your PayPal balance if we cannot refund it to your bank account.\nFor purchases you make in a seller's store location that you paid for using your PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will be refunded to your PayPal balance.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal performed a currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>within 1 day of the date of the original payment, the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) used at the time of the original payment will apply.<\/li>\n<li>beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) on the date of the refund will apply.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\nThis means that you may not receive the full amount of your original payment due to the fees above and fluctuations in currency conversion rates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Payments will be refunded in the currency you paid, or if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.<\/p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction Selecting a preferred payment method <p>In certain countries, you can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.<\/p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions and automatic payments with a seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the \"Manage\" link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.<\/p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.<\/p> Sending payments to friends and family <p>When you send payments to friends and family using your PayPal balance (if available) or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the \"Change\" link on the Send Payments page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send the payment.<\/p>\nAutomatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way to pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can select a payment method for future purchases with a particular seller either at the time of creating the agreement or in your account settings.\nFor example, you can instruct your monthly movie subscription service to always charge your credit card for the monthly cost.<\/p>\n<p>If your chosen payment method is unavailable (e.g.\ncredit card expired), a particular agreement with a seller does not provide for the ability to specify a payment method, or if you have not designated a payment method for future transactions with a seller, the payment method used will be in the following order, as applicable: 1.\nbalance.\n2.\nbank account (instant transfer).\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\ndebit card.\n6.\ncredit card.\nand 7.\neCheque.<\/p>\n<p>You can cancel any agreement in your account settings.<\/p>\nBank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.<\/p> eCheque <p>eCheque is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside of your country/region.<\/p>\n<p>If eCheque is your preferred payment method, it will be used to fund your PayPal payment, even if you have a balance.<\/p> PayPal’s Buyer Protection Program PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal's Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Buyer Protection program.\nPayPal's original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal's Buyer Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal's Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an \"Item Not Received\" claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a \"Significantly Not as Described\" claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Buyer Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions.<\/p>\nItem Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>will not<\/em> qualify for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program for an Item Not Received claim if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller's store location, or<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to your address, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p> Significantly Not As Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller's description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as \"new\" but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\nit is counterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn't receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was materially damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially similar to the seller's description of it.<\/li>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as \"used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIneligible items and transactions under PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in all or part of a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller's store location.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government agency.<\/li>\n<li>Stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal payments.\n<\/li>\n<li>Payments sent using PayPal to any bill payment service.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay or guest checkout transactions (i.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account).<\/li>\n<li>Send payment transactions where the sender pays the PayPal transaction fee.<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nTransaction eligibility for PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.\n<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Centre within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, and follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nOur online dispute resolution process <p>If you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Centre to pursue a claim under our Buyer Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 1:<\/strong>\n<strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 2:<\/strong>\n<strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the Resolution Centre.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 3:<\/strong>\n<strong>Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 4:<\/strong>\n<strong>Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you're filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.<\/p>\nProof of delivery means: <p>For transactions that total less than $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/ or postal code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.<\/p>\n<p>For transactions that total $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery (except for buyers having a PayPal account registered: in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Iceland, Israel, or Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Signature<\/strong>\n<strong>confirmation currency

USD<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 5: PayPal will make a final decision<\/strong> (including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.<\/p>\n<p>In the event that PayPal makes a final decision in favour of the buyer or seller, each party must comply with PayPal's decision.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal finds in favour of a buyer, PayPal will reimburse the buyer for the full purchase price of the item and original shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>In a seller loses a claim, the seller will not receive a refund on the PayPal fees associated with the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If a seller loses a Significantly Not as Described claim due to the item sold being counterfeit, the seller will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you will not receive the item back.<\/p>\nDispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a credit card or debit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don't qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Buyer Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can't do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we'll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won't affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).\nBefore contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller's return policy.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSelling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services Receiving personal payments <p>The ability to receive payments varies by country/region.\nYou can determine whether you have the ability to receive payments by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.<\/li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you a personal payment for a purchase.\nIf you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account's ability to accept payments from friends or family members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Terms.<\/p>\nNo surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.<\/p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, wherever PayPal’s branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal’s services or marks.<\/p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal service as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over any PayPal service.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising and other customer communications), you agree to display the PayPal services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.<\/p>\nTaxes, information reporting <p>Some of our fees may be subject to applicable taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including, for example, value-added tax, sales tax, income tax, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, \"taxes\") and, unless expressly noted, our fees are exclusive of applicable taxes.\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.<\/p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy, where required by law.<\/p>\nPayment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you by email and/or through your PayPal account.<\/p> In-store payments <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace's or the third party application's buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a \"card not present\" transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.<\/p>\nAccepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer's account through preauthorized payments either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer, \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers:<\/p>\n<p>You must:<\/p>\n<p>You must not:<\/p>\n<p>Get each buyer's prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.<\/p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer's written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancellation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.<\/p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.<\/p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer's option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.<\/p> Automatic Transfer Countries <p>If you are a resident of an Automatic Transfer Country, then you have the ability to receive payments, but you must withdraw the full amount of your payment through an available withdrawal method.\nIf you do not do so, the amounts will be automatically withdrawn from your PayPal account to your withdrawal method on a regular basis.\nFor additional terms regarding Automatic Transfer, please click here.<\/p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments Standard transactions fees <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on the buyer's country/region.\nThe fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Commercial Payments Fees table.\nPlease note that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 14 days' advance notice of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.<\/li>\n<li>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.<\/li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Merchant rate <p>To qualify for our merchant rate, you must submit a one-time application, have a qualifying monthly sales volume, and have a business account in good standing.\nTo view Merchant rate criteria click here.<\/p>\nMicropayments Fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10 USD.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative PayPal balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the <strong>Micropayment Fees table<\/strong> will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of the Commercial Payments Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.<\/p>\n<p>By applying for Micropayments for Digital Goods, you agree that for digital goods transactions you receive up to the amounts in the <strong>table<\/strong>, then if a buyer opens a Dispute, PayPal may reverse the transaction, and remove the funds from your account without requiring the buyer to escalate the dispute to a claim.<\/p>\nPayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal's Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal business account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand<\/li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.\n<\/p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay services, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.<\/p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee described below).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account in the same currency as the original transaction.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.\n(This will not apply to residents of Mainland China who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.)<\/p>\n<p>The buyer's account will be credited with the full payment amount, or a portion of the payment amount in the event of a partial refund, we'll retain the fixed fee portion of the fees you paid, and the amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.<\/p>\nPayments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Buyer Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.<\/li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven't opted out).<\/li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer's bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.<\/li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized.<\/li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement, the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy or any other agreement between you and PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of the payment sent to you may be calculated in that currency, using PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover your liability for the payment amount plus the fees, then this will result in a negative PayPal balance.\nAny negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your PayPal balance to eliminate it.\nIf you do not do so, PayPal may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>recover any amounts due to PayPal by debiting your balance;<\/li>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you;<\/li>\n<li>take any and all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nDispute fees<p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout<strong>.\n<\/strong>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee <\/strong>rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee <\/strong>rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> amount will be determined when the dispute is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your disputes ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions<\/strong>\n<strong>, <\/strong>and all chargebacks from the buyer’s card issuer or reversals from the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>If your Disputes Ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.<\/p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee <\/strong>for disputes that are<em>:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal’s Seller Protection<\/strong> program.<\/li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a <strong>Standard Dispute fee.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>Decided in your favour by PayPal or your issuer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees <\/strong>may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.<\/p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.<\/p>\n<p>This Dispute fees section does not apply to residents of Malaysia who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\nChargeback fees<p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, PayPal will charge you a chargeback fee for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee will apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.<\/p>\n<p>The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is the amount specified on the Chargeback Fees table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the Chargeback fee table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.<\/p>\n<p>If a buyer files a chargeback, the card issuer, not PayPal, will determine who wins the chargeback.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee Table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the Chargeback Fee Table the fee assessed in your primary holding currency.<\/p>\nImpact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal's Buyer Protection program and if you sell goods and services to and receive payments from buyers with PayPal accounts in countries/regions other than your own, you should also be familiar with the PayPal Buyer Protection available to buyers in each of those countries/regions.\nBuyers' rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find this information for PayPal's programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer's location at the top of the page and referring to the applicable user agreement for that geography.<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal's Buyer Protection program in any country/region:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be required to reimburse PayPal for your liability.<\/li>\n<li>Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back), and the PayPal fees that you were charged for the transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay's decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover such claim.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>We offer Seller Protection based on the Seller Protection program for the country/region you selected when you opened your account.\nThe Seller Protection program for the following countries/regions are part of this user agreement.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Central Europe, Middle East and Africa<\/strong> (excluding Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other countries covered by a country/region-specific User Agreement)<\/li>\n<\/ul> What's eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under <strong>Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks<\/strong>, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal's Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal's Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize or benefit from funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an \"<strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>\" and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They did not receive the item from you (referred to as an \"<strong>Item Not Received<\/strong>\" claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer's bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal's Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the <strong>Impact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers<\/strong>.<\/p>\nBasic requirements<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You provide us with valid proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a tangible item except for items subject to the Intangible Goods Additional Requirements.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Centre.\nIf you do not respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>You must accept payment from a PayPal account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).<\/li>\n<li>The payment must be marked “eligible” or “partially eligible” in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims, for PayPal's Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nItem Not Received additional requirement<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection program for a buyer's Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked \"eligible\" or \"partially eligible\" for PayPal's Seller Protection on the transaction details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements:<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third-party or if you have a native app integration.<\/li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>Paid standard transaction fees on the sale.<\/li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of shipment or delivery for Intangible Goods.<\/li>\n<li>Provide signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table.\nIf the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nEstablishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods:<\/p>\n<p>Proof of shipment<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery<\/p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the transaction details page<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of delivery and \"delivered\" status of the item or service.<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<li>Signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes exceeds) the fixed amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table .\nSignature confirmation is online documentation, viewable at the shipping company's website, indicating that the item was signed for (save for Sellers having a PayPal Account registered in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT<\/strong>: Your choice of carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.\nPlease ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide ‘delivered' status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for intangible goods:<\/p>\n<p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.\nCompelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Received or accessed by the

<p>If we believe that you've engaged in any of these activities, we may take a number of actions to protect PayPal, its customers and others at any time in our sole discretion.\nThe actions we may

penalty to us;<\/li>\n<li>Refuse to provide the PayPal services to you now and in the future;<\/li>\n<li>Limit your access to our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used

addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal's damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.\nYou acknowledge and agree that

the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.\nPayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing PayPal balance in any PayPal account you control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we close your PayPal account or terminate your use of the PayPal services for any reason, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and make any unrestricted funds held in your PayPal account available for

arising out of your breach of this user agreement, and/or your use of the PayPal services.<\/p> Holds, Limitations and Reserves What are holds, limitations and reserves <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nUnless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we'll provide you with notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these actions.\nTo request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.<\/p>\n<p>In order to facilitate PayPal’s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal’s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.<\/p>\nHolds<p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the funds shall not be available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.<\/li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.<\/li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHolds based on PayPal’s risk decisions<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe'll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.\n<\/p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 30 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account unless PayPal has a reason to continue to hold the payment.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you've uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 30 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we'll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved.<\/p>\nHolds related to Marketplace transactions<p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third-party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third-party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third-party directly.<\/p>\nHolds based on disputed transactions<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we'll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we'll remove the funds from your PayPal account.<\/p>\nAccount Limitations<p>Limitations prevent you from completing certain actions with your PayPal account, such as withdrawing, sending or receiving payments.\nThese limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why we may limit your access to your PayPal account or the PayPal services, and/or limit access to your funds, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we'll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.<\/li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you've received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks selling an entirely new or high cost product, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we limit access to your PayPal account, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and the opportunity to request restoration of access if, in our sole discretion, we deem it appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>\nReserves<p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some of the transactions will be shown as \"pending\" in your PayPal balance, and you will not be able to withdraw funds in a \"pending\" status, in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors, and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, we'll notify you of our actions and the terms of the reserve.<\/p>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve<\/strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the funds you receive on day 1 are held and then released on day 91, 10% of the funds you receive on day 2 are held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve<\/strong> is a specific minimum amount that you're required to keep available in your PayPal balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we'll notify you of the new terms.\n<\/p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place as long as reasonably necessary as determined by PayPal.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nLiability for Unauthorized Transactions Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n<\/p>\nWhat is an Unauthorized Transaction<p>An \"Unauthorized Transaction\" occurs when a payment is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.<\/p>\nWhat is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction<p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nReporting an Unauthorized Transaction<p>You should contact PayPal customer service immediately if you believe:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>there has been an Unauthorized Transaction sent from your account;<\/li>\n<li>there has been unauthorized access to your account;<\/li>\n<li>your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen.\nor<\/li>\n<li>any device you have used to access your PayPal account has been lost, stolen or deactivated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You must give us all the available information relating to circumstances of any Unauthorized Transactions, and/or misappropriated or unauthorized use of your account, and take all reasonable steps requested to assist PayPal in its investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If you notify us of an Unauthorized Transaction within 60 days of the transaction and we are satisfied that it was an Unauthorized Transaction, you will be eligible for 100% protection for the Unauthorized Transaction.<\/p> Error Resolution What is an Error<p>An \"Error\" means the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a processing error made by PayPal or its suppliers in which your PayPal account is mistakenly debited or credited, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.<\/li>\n<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nWhat is not considered an Error<p>The following are NOT considered errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>If you erroneously send a payment to the wrong party, or send a payment for the wrong amount (based on a typographical error, for example).\n(Your only recourse in this instance will be to contact the party to whom you sent the payment and ask them to refund the payment.\nPayPal will not reimburse you or reverse a payment that you have made in error.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIn case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers<p>Contact us at our Resolution Centre.<\/p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name, email address and account number (if any).<\/li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.<\/li>\n<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.\nWe will complete our investigation within 10 Business Days after we receive your notification of the suspected error.\nIf we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, we will credit your PayPal account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the provisional credit during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nWe will notify you of the provisional credit within 2 Business Days of the crediting.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not provisionally credit your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nFor new PayPal accounts (the first transaction from your account was less than 30 Business Days from the date you notify us), we may take up to 20 Business Days to complete the investigation.<\/p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation of our decision.\nIf you received a provisional credit, we will remove it from your account and notify you of the date and amount of the debit.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If we determine that there was an error, we will promptly credit the full amount into your account within 1 Business Day of our determination.\nOr, if you have already received a provisional credit, you will be allowed to retain those amounts.<\/p> Processing Errors <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover.\nIf the error results in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You receive less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.<\/li>\n<li>You receive more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.<\/li>\n<li>Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: <ul>\n<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;<\/li>\n<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/li>\n<li>the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Processing errors are not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.<\/li>\n<li>Delays based on a payment review.<\/li>\n<li>Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.<\/li>\n<li>Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount that you are sending).<\/li>\n<\/ul> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nOther Legal Terms Communications Between You and Us <p>You agree that PayPal and its affiliates may contact you by email for marketing purposes.\nYou may opt-out of receiving marketing communications when you open a PayPal account, by changing your account preferences or by clicking

or the PayPal services, even if you have opted-out of receiving marketing communications.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide us your mobile phone number, you agree that PayPal and its affiliates may contact you at that number using autodialed or prerecorded message calls or text messages to: (i) inform you about your use of the PayPal services and/or service your PayPal accounts, (ii) investigate or prevent fraud, or (iii) collect a debt.\nWe will not use autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to contact you for marketing purposes unless we receive your prior consent.\nWe may share your mobile phone number with service providers with whom we contract to assist us with the activities listed above, but will not share your mobile phone number with third parties for their own purposes without your consent.\nYou do not have to agree to receive autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to your mobile phone number in order to use and enjoy the products and services offered by PayPal.\nYou can decline to receive autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to your mobile phone number in several ways, including, via an email transaction receipt, in your account settings, or by contacting PayPal Customer Service.\nHowever, we may still call you directly using other means if we need to speak with you.\nStandard telephone minute and text charges may apply.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal may communicate with you about any PayPal account or transaction information and the PayPal services electronically.\nIt is your responsibility to keep your primary email address up to date so that PayPal can communicate with you electronically.\nYou understand and agree that if PayPal sends you an electronic communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic communications, PayPal will be deemed to have provided the communication to you effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add PayPal to your email address book so that you will be able to view the communications we send to you.<\/p>\n<p>You can update your primary email address or street address at any time by logging into the PayPal website.\nIf your email address becomes invalid such that electronic communications sent to you by PayPal are returned, PayPal may deem your account to be inactive, and you will not be able to transact any activity using your PayPal Account until we receive a valid, working primary email address from you.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal reserves the right to close your account if you withdraw your consent to receive electronic communications.<\/p>\n<p>You will be considered to have received a communication from us, if it's delivered electronically, 24 hours after the time we post it to our website or email it to you.\nYou will be considered to have received a communication from us, if it's delivered by mail, 3 Business Days after we send it.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you're communicating with us about a matter where we've specified another notice address (for example, our Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors process), written notices to PayPal must be sent by postal mail to: PayPal Pte.\nLtd., Attention: Legal Department, 5 Temasek Boulevard #09-01, Suntec Tower Five, Singapore 038985.<\/p>\n<p>You understand and agree that, to the extent permitted by law, PayPal may, without further notice or warning, monitor or record telephone conversations you or anyone acting on your behalf has with PayPal or its agents for quality control and training purposes or for our own protection.\nYou acknowledge and understand that while your communications with PayPal may be overheard, monitored, or recorded not all telephone lines or calls may be recorded by PayPal, and PayPal does not guarantee that recordings of any particular telephone calls will be retained or retrievable.<\/p> PayPal's Rights PayPal suspension and termination rights <p>PayPal, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to suspend or terminate this user agreement, access to or use of its websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services)

unrestricted funds held in your PayPal balance.<\/p> Security interest <p>As security for the performance of your obligations under this user agreement, you grant to PayPal a lien on, and security interest in and to, your PayPal balance in the possession of PayPal.<\/p>\nAmounts owed to PayPal <p>If your PayPal balance becomes negative for any reason, that negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to PayPal.\nPayPal may set off these amounts from funds that are subsequently added to your PayPal account, either by you or from payments you receive.\nIf you have more than one PayPal account, we may set off a negative PayPal balance in one PayPal account against a PayPal balance in your other PayPal account(s).\nIf you continue using your PayPal account when it has a negative balance, you authorize PayPal to combine the negative balance with any debit or transaction sent from your account when that combination is disclosed to you in advance of initiating the debit or transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold funds in a PayPal account in multiple currencies, and the balance for one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, PayPal may set off the negative PayPal balance by using funds you maintain in a different currency.\nIf you have a negative balance in non-relevant currency for a period of 21 days or longer, PayPal will convert this negative balance to relevant currency.\nIn either case, a currency conversion will be necessary, and PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the above, if you have a past due amount owed to PayPal, our affiliates, or eBay, PayPal may debit your PayPal account to pay any amounts that are past due.\nThis includes amounts owed by using our various products such as Xoom or Braintree.<\/p>\nInsolvency proceedings<p>If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of any bankruptcy or insolvency law, we'll be entitled

invalidates and reverses a payment that you made to a recipient (either at your initiative or otherwise), you agree that PayPal assumes your rights against the recipient and third parties related to the payment, and may pursue those rights directly or on your behalf, in PayPal's discretion.<\/p>\nNo waiver<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under this user agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.<\/p> Indemnification and Limitation of Liability <p>In this section, we use the term \"PayPal\" to refer to PayPal Pte.\nLtd.\nand our affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, joint ventures, service providers and suppliers.\nOur affiliates

significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.\n&nbsp;For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp.\nWhen you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp.\nExamples of account connections include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;<\/li>\n<li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials.\nor<\/li>\n<li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp.\nFor example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp.\nIf you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.\n&nbsp;We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp.\nBefore authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp.\nFor example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp;<\/p> 7.&nbsp;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?&nbsp.\n<p>When you visit our Sites, use

significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.\n&nbsp;For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp.\nWhen you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp.\nExamples of account connections include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;<\/li>\n<li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials.\nor<\/li>\n<li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp.\nFor example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp.\nIf you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.\n&nbsp;We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp.\nBefore authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp.\nFor example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp;<\/p> 7.&nbsp;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?&nbsp.\n<p>When you visit our Sites, use

effective for all users as of November 9, 2020.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to PayPal!<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal, Inc.\ngoverning your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nIt applies to U.S.\nPayPal accounts only.\nIf you are an individual, you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your state of residence to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of, the United States or one of its territories to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nThe terms include an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration on an individual basis.\nYou also agree to comply with each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you and the following additional policies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>Electronic Communications Delivery Policy (E-Sign Disclosure and Consent)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may revise this agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you at least 21 days advance notice for personal accounts and at least 5 days advance notice for business accounts.\nBy continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement, you agree to abide and be bound by those changes.\nIf you do not agree with any changes to this user agreement, you may close your account.<\/p> Opening a PayPal Account <p>We offer two types of PayPal accounts: personal PayPal accounts and business PayPal accounts, both covered by this user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive money.<\/li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.<\/li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, or other payment options, including funds held as balance in a business PayPal account (if we have verified the required identifying information you provide to us) or funds held in a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account linked to a personal PayPal account if you choose to open a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nThe term “Cash Account” in this user agreement will be used to refer to either a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, Cash Account and other payment methods from others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nYou must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Personal PayPal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send money to family and friends, a personal PayPal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal PayPal account you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and request money from friends and family.<\/li>\n<li>Buy goods and services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also use a personal PayPal account to receive money for the sale of goods and services and hold that money in a linked Cash Account or transfer it to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not open a Cash Account, but if you plan to use your personal PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should open a business PayPal account.\nYou can also convert your personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account should circumstances change.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Business PayPal accounts <p>We recommend business PayPal accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services or accept donations, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business PayPal account, you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your business PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your business PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Business PayPal accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business PayPal account or converting a personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business PayPal account.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Commercial Entity Status <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your PayPal account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to a personal PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any funds held in your Cash Account before closing your personal PayPal account, and closing a personal PayPal account will result in PayPal automatically closing any linked Cash Account.\nIf you have a business PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any balance from your business PayPal account before closing it, and if you have not provided the required identifying information to us, or if we are unable to verify the required identifying information you provide, you must transfer any balance in your business PayPal account to a linked bank account or debit card.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your personal or business PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.<\/p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink certain payment methods such as a credit card, debit card, a U.S.\nbank account or PayPal Credit to your PayPal account.\nYou can also link a Cash Account to your personal PayPal account as a payment method and unlink the Cash Account by withdrawing all funds and closing it.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.\nTo do this, we will charge $1.95 to the card.\nAfter the card is confirmed, we will immediately refund this amount to the card.<\/p> Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds Personal PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to your personal PayPal account cannot be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nWhen you receive money to your personal PayPal account, you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transfer the money via a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your personal PayPal account for free;<\/li>\n<li>transfer the money via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your personal PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Funds (for personal PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal;<\/li>\n<li>request PayPal to send the money to you by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nIf you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your linked Cash Account if you have one or hold the funds on your behalf and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.\nWe will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you;<\/li>\n<li>open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nA Cash Account is separate account from your personal PayPal account.\nIf you open a Cash Account, we will automatically link your Cash Account to your personal PayPal account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You also cannot transfer money to your personal PayPal account to be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nYou will need to open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account, which can be used for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Except as provided below, any balance in your Cash Account and any funds sent to you which have not yet been transferred to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not have a Cash Account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<\/p>\n<p>PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.\nYou will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.\nPayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.\nPayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from PayPal’s corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a PayPal Cash Card debit card as part of a Cash Account, have enrolled in Direct Deposit, or have established Goals in PayPal, such funds will have pass-through FDIC insurance as further detailed in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Business PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to a business PayPal account can be held directly as balance in the business PayPal account.\nThe balance functionality in your business PayPal account will differ depending on whether we have been able to verify the required identifying information that you provide to us.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>The required identifying information is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For sole proprietorships: name, physical address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number.\nor<\/li>\n<li>For other types of business legal entities: business name, business address, taxpayer identification number, and proof of business existence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we have not verified the required identifying information, a balance in your business PayPal account can only be held in your business PayPal account and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card or you can request PayPal to send you the money by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nYour balance may also be used to fund payments or money owed to PayPal, such as payments on your PayPal Working Capital account or monies owed for refunds or chargebacks.<\/p>\n<p>If we have verified the required identifying information, a balance can be held in your business PayPal account, transferred to a linked bank account or debit card, used to make purchases or send money to others.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a business PayPal account and we have verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you may transfer money to the balance of your business PayPal account from any bank account linked to your business PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer from your bank account.\nIf we have not verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you cannot add funds to your balance in a business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>You can withdraw balance from your business PayPal account by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it via a standard transfer to a bank account linked to your business PayPal account for free,<\/li>\n<li>transferring it via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your business PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal,<\/li>\n<li>withdrawing it from an ATM (automated teller machine) if you have a PayPal-branded debit card (fees may apply), or<\/li>\n<li>Requesting a check from us (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nIf you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your balance in your business PayPal account and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.\nWe will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Any balance you hold in your business account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<\/p>\n<p>PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.\nYou will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.\nPayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.\nPayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nHowever, the claim against PayPal represented by your PayPal funds is not secured by these investments and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from PayPal’s corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Restrictions on transfers or withdrawals from PayPal accounts <p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting two out of three of the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit or debit card information.<\/li>\n<li>Providing your social security number.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies Holding currency other than U.S.\ndollars <p>Your balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, if you have one, may be held in currencies other than U.S.\ndollars.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the funds to balance in another currency.\nIf you convert funds in your account, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.<\/li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the funds in U.S.\ndollars.\nIn order to withdraw funds in your account held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to U.S.\ndollars, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal’s currency conversion rate, including our currency conversion spread, will be used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To receive money in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, in that currency or convert the money into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the money into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the money is converted, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal Cash Account or business PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion spread applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).<\/p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe applicable currency conversion spread can be found on our Fees page under the heading Currency conversion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines a currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorize PayPal to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nCurrency preference selections may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, and may be made available individually for each card and for each automatic payment agreement.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where your Cash Account balance, business PayPal account balance or linked bank account is the payment method.<\/p> Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, you will receive two statements: one showing all transactions in your personal PayPal account and an additional statement showing only transactions involving your Cash Account.<\/p> Sending Money and Buying Sending Money to a Friend or Family Member Sending money <p>You can send money to a friend or family member using the send money feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called “personal payments” or “peer-to-peer/P2P payments”).\nYou can send money to a friend or family member even if they don’t have a PayPal account at the time you send them money, using their email address or mobile number in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don’t claim it, it will be refunded to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can send, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>When you send money to a friend or family member who has a PayPal account, one of two things may happen: they may accept or decline the money.\nIf they decline to accept the money, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card, PayPal Credit, a Cash Account, or balance in a business PayPal account as the payment method, or<\/li>\n<li>The balance in your business PayPal account or the balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account if you used a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>If you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending money can be found on our Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family page and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send money to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert money in your Cash Account balance or in your business PayPal account balance from one currency to another before sending money, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nIf you use your credit card as the payment method when sending money, you may also be charged a cash-advance fee by your card issuer.<\/p>\n<p>If you send money to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party’s product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the send money feature in your PayPal account to pay for goods or services.\nYou will not be charged any transaction fee for sending money to purchase goods or services as long as you choose the “send money to pay for goods and services” feature in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, the seller will pay a fee.\nYou must not use the “send money to a friend or family member” feature in your PayPal account when you are paying for goods or services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal <p>&nbsp;<\/p> How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, in any currency that the seller accepts and that PayPal supports using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer’s website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Sending money to a seller for goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller’s physical store using an electronic terminal, subject to certain limitations.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller’s physical store using your own mobile device and a QR code, subject to certain limitations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don’t open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.<\/p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third party websites or applications.<\/p>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a currency conversion spread) will be used, and may be the rate at the time the payment is processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Fees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal you don’t pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nYour debit or credit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for non-U.S.\ntransactions.<\/p>\n<p>In addition you may be required to pay a fee to PayPal if you are making a purchase using PayPal Business Payments and the seller discloses to you that you, as the buyer, must pay the fee.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don’t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Automatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows you to pay the seller on a one-time, recurring or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a “billing agreement,” \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>If you have a personal PayPal account, you may cancel a recurring automatic payment up to 3 <strong>Business Days<\/strong> before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the <strong>PayPal Help Center<\/strong>, or by calling PayPal at (888) 221-1161.<\/p>\n<p>Once your automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller money for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for.<\/p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal’s <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a debit card, credit card, PayPal Credit, or a balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a personal PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your linked Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a business PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your balance in your business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller’s store location that you paid for using your personal PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller’s store location that you paid for using your business PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your balance in your business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you used Pay with Rewards to fund your transaction, your refund will be processed back as a dollar amount: depending on your card agreement with your issuer, your issuer may or may not credit your purchase back to your reward balance.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal performed currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) used at the time of the original payment will apply.<\/li>\n<li>Beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) on the date of the refund will apply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Money will be refunded in the currency you paid.\nor if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.\nor we are unable to refund in your primary holding currency, then in U.S.\ndollars.<\/p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction <p>&nbsp;<\/p> Selecting a preferred payment method <p>You can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences on <strong>www.paypal.com<\/strong> or in the PayPal app.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.<\/p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions, and each of your automatic payment agreements, as described below.<\/p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.<\/p>\n<p>If no preferred payment method, it’s still your choice.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the “Manage” link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for in-store or automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Sending money to friends and family <p>When you send money to friends and family within the U.S.\nusing balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the balance in your business PayPal account, or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the “Change” link on the Send Money page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send money.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Automatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way you pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\nTo help minimize disruptions in your automatic payments, we may update your Payment Method information.\nsee Link or Unlink a Payment Method.<\/p>\n<p>When you first set up an automatic payment agreement, you may have the option to set up a preferred payment method for such agreement.\nYou can review, set, or change a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement in your account settings on paypal.com.<\/p>\n<p>Your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement will be used for transactions with that seller.\nIf you have available balance in a linked Cash or cash Plus account, that balance may be used before your preferred payment method.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not set a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement, or if your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement is unavailable (for example, because it is expired or has insufficient funds) the payment method used will be in the following order, if applicable: 1.\nCash Account (if one is linked to your personal PayPal account) or balance in your business PayPal account (if we’ve been able to verify the <strong>required identifying information<\/strong> you provide to us).\n2.\nBank account.\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\nDebit card.\n6.\nCredit card.\nand 7.\nE-check.\nThis is also the order of payment methods that will be used if a previously selected payment method to be used in a seller agreement is unavailable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Bank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.<\/p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to pay for an item and you select your bank account as the funding method for the transaction, remember that your PayPal account is issued to you by PayPal and not your bank.\nThe terms, benefits, and protections associated with your PayPal account may vary from those that apply to your bank account.\nIf you use your PayPal account to make a purchase that exceeds the balance in your linked bank account, you could incur overdraft fees, even if you chose not to allow overdrafts with your bank.\nSimilarly, the liability limits applicable to your PayPal account may differ from those applicable to your bank account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> E-check <p>E-check is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside the United States.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Pay with Rewards <p>PayPal may allow you to redeem rewards associated with your eligible card(s) when making a purchase with your PayPal account through PayPal’s Pay with Rewards program.\nPayPal may share with and receive information from your issuer about your issuer accounts to complete the redemption of your rewards when using PayPal’s Pay with Rewards program.\nThe exchange of this information is necessary to complete the purchase when you select the Pay with Rewards redemption option.<\/p> All Pay with Rewards redemptions are subject to the terms of your card agreement with your card issuer.\nPay with Rewards is only available for eligible purchases with certain merchants, and PayPal or your issuer may limit, suspend, or terminate your ability to redeem rewards at any time in accordance with this user agreement and your card agreement.\nYour issuer determines the value of rewards redeemed through PayPal and available redemption methods (e.g., to pay for your purchase or for a statement credit).\nThere may be a delay between checkout and processing of your payment.\nOnly rewards available upon processing of your payment will be used.\nBecause your reward balance and/or transaction balance may change, whenever you request to redeem rewards for a purchase you also authorize PayPal to charge up to the full payment amount to your associated card if that happens.\nFor more information on redeeming rewards and how it works, please see About Payment Methods.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Debit card processing <p>PayPal will process your debit or prepaid card funded transactions through either the ATM debit network or the Visa, MasterCard or Discover network.\nIf we process your debit or prepaid card through an ATM debit network, we may provide you with the opportunity to switch to a Visa, MasterCard or Discover network by changing your preferences for that debit or prepaid card through your PayPal account profile.<\/p> Loyalty Cards <p>If you use the PayPal application on your mobile phone, you may store loyalty card numbers or bar codes, where applicable, for certain sellers in your PayPal account.\nWhen you store your loyalty card numbers or bar codes in your PayPal account, you will earn any rewards, subject to the seller’s loyalty card terms and conditions, at the time you make your payment to the merchant by presenting the stored loyalty card number or bar code to the seller at the point of sale.\nIt is your responsibility to make sure you have entered your loyalty card information correctly and that you update it as necessary.\nIt is also your responsibility to ensure that you are receiving the rewards to which you are entitled.\nPayPal is not responsible for managing your loyalty card account by offering this service and any questions about your loyalty card or associated rewards program should be directed to the seller who offers the card.<\/p> PayPal’s Purchase Protection Program <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal’s Purchase Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Purchase Protection program.\nPayPal’s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal’s Purchase Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal’s Purchase Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn’t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn’t what you ordered (referred to as a “Significantly Not as Described” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Purchase Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <strong>\n<em>will not<\/em>\n<\/strong> qualify for a refund under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program for an Item Not Received claim, if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller’s physical store, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions, or<\/li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller’s description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as “new” but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn’t receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as “used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Purchase Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller’s store location, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government agency.<\/li>\n<li>Stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal Payments.<\/li>\n<li>Payments sent using PayPal to any bill payment service.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay or guest checkout transactions (i.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account).<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Transaction eligibility for PayPal’s Purchase Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Purchase Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment and follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you’re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> to pursue a claim under our Purchase Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.\n<\/p>\n<p>Step 3: <strong>Respond to PayPal’s requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4: <strong>Comply with PayPal’s shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you’re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery means:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For transactions that total less than $750 U.S.\ndollars (or the currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or zip code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.<\/li>\n<li>For transactions that total $750 U.S.\ndollar (or the currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Signature confirmation currency thresholds

MXN<\/p>\n<p>U.S.\nDollar:<\/p>\n<p>750 USD<\/p>\n<p>Step 5: <strong>PayPal will make a final decision <\/strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don’t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Purchase Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can’t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we’ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won’t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).<\/p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller’s return policy.<\/p> Selling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services <p>&nbsp;<\/p> Receiving personal payments <p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.<\/li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you money using the “send money to a friend or family member.” If you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account’s ability to accept payments from friends or family members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> No surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Presentation of PayPal and Pay with Venmo <p>You must treat PayPal and/or Venmo as payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale where PayPal or Venmo branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal or Venmo services or marks.\n<\/p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal or Venmo services or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal or Venmo services.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or Venmo services or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal or Venmo, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising, and other customer communications) you agree to display the PayPal or Venmo services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Taxes and information reporting <p>Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “taxes”).\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process.\nFor example, PayPal is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of payments for goods and services you receive each calendar year into all of your PayPal accounts associated with the same tax identification number if you receive more than $20,000 in payments for good and services and process more than 200 transactions involving goods or services through those PayPal accounts in the same calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Your customer service information, refunds and returns policy, and privacy policy <p>You must publish customer service information with clear instructions on how your customers can contact you.\nSuch instructions must include at least: (1) one active customer service email address or active customer service URL to file tickets for assistance and/or (2) one active customer service telephone number.\nSuch information must be readily accessible for review by your customers.<\/p>\n<p>You must publish a refunds and returns policy.<\/p>\n<p>You must publish a privacy policy, where required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal's Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you about payment reviews by email and/or through your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer’s account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes intended for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions, you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace’s or the third party application’s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> PayPal Giving Fund <p>If you are a charity and hold a PayPal account, you may be eligible to participate in PayPal Giving Fund programs.\nPayPal Giving Fund is a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code as a tax-exempt public charity (Federal Tax ID: 45-0931286).\nIf you meet the eligibility requirements in the <strong>Nonprofit Certification Policy<\/strong> and are either a “Public Charity” under Section 509(a) of the Code or a \"Private Operating Foundation\" under IRS regulations, you may be automatically enrolled with PayPal Giving Fund upon acceptance of this user agreement.\nYou will receive an email from us confirming your enrollment.\nYour relationship with PayPal Giving Fund will be governed by the <strong>Nonprofit User Agreement<\/strong>, including receiving email communications from PayPal Giving Fund about its current and future partners about its programs.\nYou can opt out of email communications at any time in your <strong>PayPal Giving Fund profile<\/strong>.\nIf you don’t want to be enrolled or receive donations from PayPal Giving Fund, you can opt-out at any time by <strong>contacting us<\/strong>.\nFor more information, please see <strong>PayPal Giving Fund’s Policies<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a “card not present” transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Accepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer’s account through preauthorized transfers either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a “billing agreement,” \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"<\/p> If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers: <p>You must:<\/p>\n<p>You must not:<\/p>\n<p>Get each buyer’s prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.<\/p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer’s written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.<\/p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancelation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.<\/p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.<\/p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer’s option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.<\/p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the country of the buyer’s account or the currency of their card;<\/li>\n<li>whether you are registered as a charitable organization and have active 501(c)(3) status.\nYour 501(c)(3) status must be documented with PayPal to receive the rates applicable to charitable organizations, and those rates will apply only after you document your status with us.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Standard transaction fees <p>The fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Standard Transaction Fees table, with the fees applicable to charitable organizations founds on the Standard Transaction Fees for Charitable Organizations table for the charitable fees.\nPlease note that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 21 days’ advance notice for personal PayPal accounts and at least 5 days’ advance notice for business PayPal accounts of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.<\/li>\n<li>If you refund a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned.<\/li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Here or PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Micropayments fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the Micropayment Fees table will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of Standard Transaction Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal’s Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nYou may be able to choose to send payments to PayPal accounts, Venmo accounts, or both.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a business PayPal account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand<\/li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.<\/p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay service, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.<\/p>\n<p>You can send money through Payouts or Mass Pay even if your receiver does not have a PayPal or Venmo account, as applicable, using their email address or mobile number.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a relevant account, they can claim it by opening one.\nIf they don’t claim it, it will be refunded to you in thirty (30) days.\nPayPal is not liable for amounts sent by you in error.\nPayPal shall have no responsibility to reverse any payout payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Your responsibility to notify PayPal of pricing or fee errors <p>Once you have access to any account statement(s) or other account activity information made available to you by PayPal with respect to your business account(s), you will have ninety (90) days to notify PayPal in writing of any errors or discrepancies with respect to the pricing or other fees applied by PayPal.\nIf you do not notify PayPal within such timeframe, you accept such information as accurate, and PayPal shall have no obligation to make any corrections.\nFor the purposes of this provision, such pricing or fee errors or discrepancies are different than Unauthorized Transactions and other electronic transfer<strong> Errors<\/strong> which are each subject to different notification timeframes as set forth herein.<\/p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks <p>&nbsp;<\/p> General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account.\nIf a currency conversion is necessary (for example if the balance in your Cash Account or your business PayPal account for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, or if the buyer paid in a different currency), PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you refund a payment for goods or services, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned to you.\nThe amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Purchase Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.<\/li>\n<li>You lose a Venmo Protected Purchase Program claim.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.<\/li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven’t opted out).<\/li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer’s bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.<\/li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized<\/li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement or any other agreement between you and PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated or reversed for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of that payment may be calculated in that currency, using the PayPal transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) that applies at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account doesn’t cover the payment amount due plus the fees, we may use any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to cover the amount due.\nIf the payment methods linked to your PayPal account don’t cover the amount due, this will result in a negative balance.\nA negative balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your balance to resolve it.\nIf you don’t, PayPal may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover the amount due from you;<\/li>\n<li>take any or all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Dispute fees <p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> table, then the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> amount will be determined when the dispute case is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your dispute ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July, and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions<\/strong>.\nand all chargebacks from the buyer’s card issuer or reversals from the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>If your dispute ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.<\/p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s<strong> Resolution Center<\/strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal’s Seller Protection<\/strong> program.<\/li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a Standard Dispute fee.<\/li>\n<li>Decided in your favor by PayPal or your issuer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s<strong> Resolution Center<\/strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees<\/strong> may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.<\/p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Chargeback fees <p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, then PayPal will charge you a <strong>Chargeback fee<\/strong> for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee with apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.<\/p> The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee table and will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Chargeback fee<\/strong> table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal’s Purchase Protection program, Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program, and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection available to buyers in each of those countries.\nBuyers’ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about PayPal’s protection programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer’s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding user agreement.\nYou can find information on Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program in Venmo’s user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program in any country, or under Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay’s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What’s eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal’s Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal’s Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount for debit and credit card-funded transactions.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal’s Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an “Unauthorized Transaction” claim), and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by Paypal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They didn’t receive the item from you (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal’s Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal’s Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the United States.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for

details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a

valid proof of shipping and delivery.\n<ul>\n<li>The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person.\nprovided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Center.\nIf you

services from you using PayPal, your bank or credit card issuer, other impacted third parties or law enforcement about your actions;<\/li>\n<li>Update inaccurate information you provided us;<\/li>\n<li>Take legal action against you;<\/li>\n<li>If you’ve violated our Acceptable Use Policy, then you’re also responsible for damages to PayPal caused by your violation of this policy.\nor<\/li>\n<li>If you are a seller and you violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal's damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.\nYou acknowledge and agree that $2,500.00 U.S.\ndollars per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.\nPayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we close your PayPal account or terminate your use of the PayPal services for any reason, we’ll provide you with notice of our actions and make any unrestricted funds held in the balance of your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account or in the balance of your business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, available for withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by PayPal, any PayPal customer, or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this agreement, and/or your use of the PayPal services.<\/p> Holds, Limitations, and Reserves <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What are holds, limitations and reserves <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nUnless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we’ll provide you with notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these actions.\nTo request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Center or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.<\/p>\n<p>In order to facilitate PayPal’s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal’s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.<\/li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.<\/li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on PayPal’s risk decisions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe’ll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.<\/p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 21 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you’ve uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 21 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we’ll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved (but no longer than 180 days).<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds related to Marketplace transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third party directly.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on disputed transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we’ll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we’ll remove the funds from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we’ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.<\/li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you’ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Reserves placed on business PayPal accounts <p>We may place a reserve on your business PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your business PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your business PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the money in your business PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your business PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your business PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve<\/strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve<\/strong> is a specific minimum amount of money that you’re required to keep available in the balance of your business PayPal account at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, the funds will be shown as \"pending\" and we’ll notify you of the terms of the reserve.<br> If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you of the new terms.<br>\n<\/p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place longer than 180 days.<\/p> PayPal User Agreement Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is an Unauthorized Transaction <p>An “Unauthorized Transaction” occurs when money is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction <p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Reporting an Unauthorized Transaction <p>If you believe your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen, please contact PayPal customer service immediately or call: (888) 221-1161 or write: PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.<\/p>\n<p>Tell us AT ONCE if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using your login information or by other means.\nYou could lose all the money in your PayPal account.\nIf you tell us within 60 days after we provide you your PayPal account statement showing transfers you did not make, you will be eligible for 100% protection for Unauthorized Transactions.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if your PayPal account statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made with your PayPal login information or by other means, tell us at once.\nIf you do not tell us within 60 days after we provided the statement to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.\nIf a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods.<\/p> Error Resolution <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is an Error <p>An “Error” means the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When money is either incorrectly taken from your PayPal account or incorrectly placed into your PayPal account, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>An incorrect amount is credited to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.<\/li>\n<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You request receipt or periodic statement documents that PayPal is required to provide to you.<\/li>\n<li>You request information concerning preauthorized (recurring) transfers to your PayPal account that PayPal is required to provide to you.<\/li>\n<li>You request additional information or clarification concerning a transfer to or from your PayPal account, including a request you make to determine whether an error has occurred.<\/li>\n<li>You inquire about the status of a pending transfer to or from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You request documentation or other information, unless the request is for a duplicate copy for tax or other record-keeping purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered an Error <p>The following are NOT considered Errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Routine inquiries about the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Requests for duplicate documentation or other information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> In case of Errors or questions about your electronic transfers <p>Telephone us at (888) 221-1161, contact us through the PayPal Resolution Center.\nor write us at PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.\n<\/p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name and account number (if any).<\/li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.<\/li>\n<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.<\/p>\n<p>We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly.\nIf we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, we will credit your PayPal account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nFor new PayPal accounts, we may take up to 20 Business Days to credit your PayPal account for the amount you think is in error.<\/p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.<\/p> Processing Errors <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover.\nIf the error results in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You receiving less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.<\/li>\n<li>You receiving more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.<\/li>\n<li>Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: <ul>\n<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;<\/li>\n<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/li>\n<li>the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Processing errors are not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.<\/li>\n<li>Delays based on a payment review.<\/li>\n<li>Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.<\/li>\n<li>Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount of money that you are sending).<\/li>\n<\/ul> Remittance Transfer Errors <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is a Remittance Transfer <p>You may be protected for certain errors when you send money using a PayPal account outside of the U.S.\nA “Remittance Transfer” is a transaction that meets the following criteria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The payment is sent from a personal PayPal account that is used primarily for personal, family or household purposes,<\/li>\n<li>The payment is made for personal, family or household purposes,<\/li>\n<li>The payment is made using the send money feature through your PayPal account,<\/li>\n<li>The payment amount equals or exceeds $15 USD (excluding fees charged to you) or the foreign currency equivalent calculated using exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction, and<\/li>\n<li>The recipient of the payment has a PayPal account in a country outside the U.S.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Payments that you make at a merchant website or location by selecting PayPal as a payment option are not “Remittance Transfers.”<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What qualifies as a Remittance Transfer Error <p>A <strong>“Remittance Transfer Error”<\/strong> occurs if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You paid an incorrect amount to send the Remittance Transfer.\nFor example, you were charged more than the total shown on the remittance transfer receipt you received (unless the total shown on the receipt was an estimate, and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes).<\/li>\n<li>PayPal made a computational or bookkeeping error, such as a miscalculation of the amount the recipient received.<\/li>\n<li>The amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt was not made available to the recipient, unless: <ul>\n<li>we stated in the remittance transfer receipt that we used estimates and the difference in the amount received and the amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, or<\/li>\n<li>the problem was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside our control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Funds were available to the recipient later than the date of availability that was disclosed to you on the remittance transfer receipt or were not delivered, unless: <ul>\n<li>extraordinary circumstances outside our control caused the delay, and we could not reasonably anticipate those circumstances,<\/li>\n<li>delays resulted from fraud screenings, or were caused by requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Controls or similar requirements, or<\/li>\n<li>you (or someone assisting you) made the transfer with fraudulent intent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>You request documentation or information concerning the Remittance Transfer, such as information required to determine if a Remittance Transfer Error occurred.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered a Remittance Transfer Error <p>The following are NOT considered Remittance Transfer Errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An inquiry about the status of a Remittance Transfer, except where the funds from the transfer were not made available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability,<\/li>\n<li>A request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes,<\/li>\n<li>A change requested by the designated recipient, or<\/li>\n<li>A change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the

(1) your use of, or your inability to use, our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, or any of the PayPal services.\n(2) delays or disruptions in our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf and any of the PayPal services.\n(3) viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal

Disclaimer of Warranty and Release <p>&nbsp;<\/p> No warranty <p>\n<strong>The PayPal services are provided “as-is” and without any representation or warranty, whether express, implied or statutory.\nPayPal specifically disclaims any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>PayPal does not have any control over the products or services provided by sellers who accept PayPal as a payment method, and PayPal cannot ensure that a buyer or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so.\nPayPal does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the PayPal services, and operation of our websites, software, or systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control.\nPayPal will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and check issuances are processed in a timely manner but PayPal makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the PayPal services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or the U.S.\nor international mail service.\nSome states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Release of PayPal <p>If you have a dispute with any other PayPal account holder, you release PayPal from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIn entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise, for example, California Civil Code § 1542) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.<\/p> Agreement to Arbitrate <p>You and PayPal agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us will be resolved in accordance with the Agreement to Arbitrate provisions set forth below.\nPlease read this information carefully.\nAmong other things it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Affects your rights and will impact how claims you and we have against each other are resolved.<\/li>\n<li>Includes a Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief pursuant to which you agree to waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit against us.<\/li>\n<li>Requires you to follow the Opt-Out Procedure to opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a written notice and the opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If a dispute arises between you and PayPal, acting as either a buyer or a seller, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns.\nIf we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, we aim to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.\nDisputes between you and PayPal regarding the PayPal services may be reported to customer service online through the PayPal Help Center at any time, or by calling (888) 221-1161 from Mon-Fri 5:00 AM to 10:00 PM PT and Sat-Sun 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM PT.<\/p> Agreement to Arbitrate <p>\n<strong>\n<em>Our Agreement<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and PayPal each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal, including without limitation federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\nThis Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em> Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and PayPal agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.\nUnless both you and PayPal agree otherwise, the arbitrator(s) may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding.\nAlso, the arbitrator(s) may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s).\nAny relief awarded cannot affect other PayPal customers.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Arbitration Procedures<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.\nHowever, the arbitrator(s) can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.\nThe arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of this user agreement as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator(s) to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (referred to as the \"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other party, by certified mail, a completed Notice of Dispute.\nYou should send this notice to PayPal at: PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.\nPayPal will send any notice to you to the address we have on file associated with your PayPal account.\nit is your responsibility to keep your address up to date.\nAll information called for in the notice must be provided including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.<\/p>\n<p>If you and PayPal are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, you or PayPal may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nA form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at www.adr.org.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or PayPal may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and PayPal subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.\nIn cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or PayPal may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator(s) require otherwise.\nAny settlement offer made by you or PayPal shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator(s).<\/p>\n<p>The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PayPal customers, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PayPal customer to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Costs of Arbitration<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, PayPal will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.\nAny request for payment of fees by PayPal should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and PayPal will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, PayPal will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator(s) deem necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive.\nIn the event the arbitrator(s) determine the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse PayPal for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by PayPal on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Severability<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\nIf a court decides that any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in court.\nAll other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall be arbitrated under its terms.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Opt-Out Procedure<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a new PayPal customer, you can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice.\nThe opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time.\nYou must mail the opt-out notice to PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.<\/p>\n<p>For your convenience, we are providing an opt-out notice form you must complete and mail to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nYou must complete this form by providing all the information it calls for, including your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the PayPal account(s) to which the opt-out applies.\nYou must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective.\nThis procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the user agreement will continue to apply.\nOpting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.<\/p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Future Amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate<\/i>\n<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision in the user agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against PayPal prior to the effective date of the amendment.\nThe amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by this Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal.\nWe will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on www.paypal.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing notice through email.\nIf you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your PayPal account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.<\/p> Intellectual Property

effective for all users as of November 9, 2020.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to PayPal!<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal, Inc.\ngoverning your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nIt applies to U.S.\nPayPal accounts only.\nIf you are an individual, you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your state of residence to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of, the United States or one of its territories to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nThe terms include an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration on an individual basis.\nYou also agree to comply with each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you and the following additional policies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>Electronic Communications Delivery Policy (E-Sign Disclosure and Consent)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may revise this agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you at least 21 days advance notice for personal accounts and at least 5 days advance notice for business accounts.\nBy continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement, you agree to abide and be bound by those changes.\nIf you do not agree with any changes to this user agreement, you may close your account.<\/p> Opening a PayPal Account <p>We offer two types of PayPal accounts: personal PayPal accounts and business PayPal accounts, both covered by this user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive money.<\/li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.<\/li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, or other payment options, including funds held as balance in a business PayPal account (if we have verified the required identifying information you provide to us) or funds held in a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account linked to a personal PayPal account if you choose to open a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nThe term “Cash Account” in this user agreement will be used to refer to either a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, Cash Account and other payment methods from others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nYou must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Personal PayPal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send money to family and friends, a personal PayPal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal PayPal account you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and request money from friends and family.<\/li>\n<li>Buy goods and services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also use a personal PayPal account to receive money for the sale of goods and services and hold that money in a linked Cash Account or transfer it to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not open a Cash Account, but if you plan to use your personal PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should open a business PayPal account.\nYou can also convert your personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account should circumstances change.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Business PayPal accounts <p>We recommend business PayPal accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services or accept donations, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business PayPal account, you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your business PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your business PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Business PayPal accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business PayPal account or converting a personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business PayPal account.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Commercial Entity Status <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your PayPal account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to a personal PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any funds held in your Cash Account before closing your personal PayPal account, and closing a personal PayPal account will result in PayPal automatically closing any linked Cash Account.\nIf you have a business PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any balance from your business PayPal account before closing it, and if you have not provided the required identifying information to us, or if we are unable to verify the required identifying information you provide, you must transfer any balance in your business PayPal account to a linked bank account or debit card.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your personal or business PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.<\/p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink certain payment methods such as a credit card, debit card, a U.S.\nbank account or PayPal Credit to your PayPal account.\nYou can also link a Cash Account to your personal PayPal account as a payment method and unlink the Cash Account by withdrawing all funds and closing it.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.\nTo do this, we will charge $1.95 to the card.\nAfter the card is confirmed, we will immediately refund this amount to the card.<\/p> Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds Personal PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to your personal PayPal account cannot be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nWhen you receive money to your personal PayPal account, you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transfer the money via a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your personal PayPal account for free;<\/li>\n<li>transfer the money via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your personal PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Funds (for personal PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal;<\/li>\n<li>request PayPal to send the money to you by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nIf you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your linked Cash Account if you have one or hold the funds on your behalf and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.\nWe will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you;<\/li>\n<li>open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nA Cash Account is separate account from your personal PayPal account.\nIf you open a Cash Account, we will automatically link your Cash Account to your personal PayPal account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You also cannot transfer money to your personal PayPal account to be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nYou will need to open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account, which can be used for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Except as provided below, any balance in your Cash Account and any funds sent to you which have not yet been transferred to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not have a Cash Account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<\/p>\n<p>PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.\nYou will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.\nPayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.\nPayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from PayPal’s corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a PayPal Cash Card debit card as part of a Cash Account, have enrolled in Direct Deposit, or have established Goals in PayPal, such funds will have pass-through FDIC insurance as further detailed in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Business PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to a business PayPal account can be held directly as balance in the business PayPal account.\nThe balance functionality in your business PayPal account will differ depending on whether we have been able to verify the required identifying information that you provide to us.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>The required identifying information is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For sole proprietorships: name, physical address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number.\nor<\/li>\n<li>For other types of business legal entities: business name, business address, taxpayer identification number, and proof of business existence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we have not verified the required identifying information, a balance in your business PayPal account can only be held in your business PayPal account and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card or you can request PayPal to send you the money by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nYour balance may also be used to fund payments or money owed to PayPal, such as payments on your PayPal Working Capital account or monies owed for refunds or chargebacks.<\/p>\n<p>If we have verified the required identifying information, a balance can be held in your business PayPal account, transferred to a linked bank account or debit card, used to make purchases or send money to others.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a business PayPal account and we have verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you may transfer money to the balance of your business PayPal account from any bank account linked to your business PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer from your bank account.\nIf we have not verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you cannot add funds to your balance in a business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>You can withdraw balance from your business PayPal account by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it via a standard transfer to a bank account linked to your business PayPal account for free,<\/li>\n<li>transferring it via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your business PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal,<\/li>\n<li>withdrawing it from an ATM (automated teller machine) if you have a PayPal-branded debit card (fees may apply), or<\/li>\n<li>Requesting a check from us (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nIf you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your balance in your business PayPal account and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.\nWe will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Any balance you hold in your business account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<\/p>\n<p>PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.\nYou will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.\nPayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.\nPayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nHowever, the claim against PayPal represented by your PayPal funds is not secured by these investments and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from PayPal’s corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Restrictions on transfers or withdrawals from PayPal accounts <p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting two out of three of the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit or debit card information.<\/li>\n<li>Providing your social security number.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies Holding currency other than U.S.\ndollars <p>Your balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, if you have one, may be held in currencies other than U.S.\ndollars.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the funds to balance in another currency.\nIf you convert funds in your account, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.<\/li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the funds in U.S.\ndollars.\nIn order to withdraw funds in your account held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to U.S.\ndollars, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal’s currency conversion rate, including our currency conversion spread, will be used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To receive money in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, in that currency or convert the money into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the money into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the money is converted, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal Cash Account or business PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion spread applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).<\/p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe applicable currency conversion spread can be found on our Fees page under the heading Currency conversion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines a currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorize PayPal to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nCurrency preference selections may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, and may be made available individually for each card and for each automatic payment agreement.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where your Cash Account balance, business PayPal account balance or linked bank account is the payment method.<\/p> Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, you will receive two statements: one showing all transactions in your personal PayPal account and an additional statement showing only transactions involving your Cash Account.<\/p> Sending Money and Buying Sending Money to a Friend or Family Member Sending money <p>You can send money to a friend or family member using the send money feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called “personal payments” or “peer-to-peer/P2P payments”).\nYou can send money to a friend or family member even if they don’t have a PayPal account at the time you send them money, using their email address or mobile number in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don’t claim it, it will be refunded to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can send, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>When you send money to a friend or family member who has a PayPal account, one of two things may happen: they may accept or decline the money.\nIf they decline to accept the money, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card, PayPal Credit, a Cash Account, or balance in a business PayPal account as the payment method, or<\/li>\n<li>The balance in your business PayPal account or the balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account if you used a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>If you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending money can be found on our Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family page and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send money to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert money in your Cash Account balance or in your business PayPal account balance from one currency to another before sending money, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nIf you use your credit card as the payment method when sending money, you may also be charged a cash-advance fee by your card issuer.<\/p>\n<p>If you send money to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party’s product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the send money feature in your PayPal account to pay for goods or services.\nYou will not be charged any transaction fee for sending money to purchase goods or services as long as you choose the “send money to pay for goods and services” feature in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, the seller will pay a fee.\nYou must not use the “send money to a friend or family member” feature in your PayPal account when you are paying for goods or services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal <p>&nbsp;<\/p> How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, in any currency that the seller accepts and that PayPal supports using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer’s website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Sending money to a seller for goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller’s physical store using an electronic terminal, subject to certain limitations.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller’s physical store using your own mobile device and a QR code, subject to certain limitations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don’t open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.<\/p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third party websites or applications.<\/p>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a currency conversion spread) will be used, and may be the rate at the time the payment is processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Fees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal you don’t pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nYour debit or credit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for non-U.S.\ntransactions.<\/p>\n<p>In addition you may be required to pay a fee to PayPal if you are making a purchase using PayPal Business Payments and the seller discloses to you that you, as the buyer, must pay the fee.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don’t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Automatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows you to pay the seller on a one-time, recurring or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a “billing agreement,” \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>If you have a personal PayPal account, you may cancel a recurring automatic payment up to 3 <strong>Business Days<\/strong> before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the <strong>PayPal Help Center<\/strong>, or by calling PayPal at (888) 221-1161.<\/p>\n<p>Once your automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller money for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for.<\/p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal’s <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a debit card, credit card, PayPal Credit, or a balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a personal PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your linked Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a business PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your balance in your business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller’s store location that you paid for using your personal PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller’s store location that you paid for using your business PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your balance in your business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you used Pay with Rewards to fund your transaction, your refund will be processed back as a dollar amount: depending on your card agreement with your issuer, your issuer may or may not credit your purchase back to your reward balance.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal performed currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) used at the time of the original payment will apply.<\/li>\n<li>Beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) on the date of the refund will apply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Money will be refunded in the currency you paid.\nor if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.\nor we are unable to refund in your primary holding currency, then in U.S.\ndollars.<\/p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction <p>&nbsp;<\/p> Selecting a preferred payment method <p>You can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences on <strong>www.paypal.com<\/strong> or in the PayPal app.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.<\/p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions, and each of your automatic payment agreements, as described below.<\/p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.<\/p>\n<p>If no preferred payment method, it’s still your choice.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the “Manage” link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for in-store or automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Sending money to friends and family <p>When you send money to friends and family within the U.S.\nusing balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the balance in your business PayPal account, or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the “Change” link on the Send Money page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send money.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Automatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way you pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\nTo help minimize disruptions in your automatic payments, we may update your Payment Method information.\nsee Link or Unlink a Payment Method.<\/p>\n<p>When you first set up an automatic payment agreement, you may have the option to set up a preferred payment method for such agreement.\nYou can review, set, or change a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement in your account settings on paypal.com.<\/p>\n<p>Your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement will be used for transactions with that seller.\nIf you have available balance in a linked Cash or cash Plus account, that balance may be used before your preferred payment method.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not set a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement, or if your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement is unavailable (for example, because it is expired or has insufficient funds) the payment method used will be in the following order, if applicable: 1.\nCash Account (if one is linked to your personal PayPal account) or balance in your business PayPal account (if we’ve been able to verify the <strong>required identifying information<\/strong> you provide to us).\n2.\nBank account.\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\nDebit card.\n6.\nCredit card.\nand 7.\nE-check.\nThis is also the order of payment methods that will be used if a previously selected payment method to be used in a seller agreement is unavailable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Bank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.<\/p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to pay for an item and you select your bank account as the funding method for the transaction, remember that your PayPal account is issued to you by PayPal and not your bank.\nThe terms, benefits, and protections associated with your PayPal account may vary from those that apply to your bank account.\nIf you use your PayPal account to make a purchase that exceeds the balance in your linked bank account, you could incur overdraft fees, even if you chose not to allow overdrafts with your bank.\nSimilarly, the liability limits applicable to your PayPal account may differ from those applicable to your bank account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> E-check <p>E-check is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside the United States.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Pay with Rewards <p>PayPal may allow you to redeem rewards associated with your eligible card(s) when making a purchase with your PayPal account through PayPal’s Pay with Rewards program.\nPayPal may share with and receive information from your issuer about your issuer accounts to complete the redemption of your rewards when using PayPal’s Pay with Rewards program.\nThe exchange of this information is necessary to complete the purchase when you select the Pay with Rewards redemption option.<\/p> All Pay with Rewards redemptions are subject to the terms of your card agreement with your card issuer.\nPay with Rewards is only available for eligible purchases with certain merchants, and PayPal or your issuer may limit, suspend, or terminate your ability to redeem rewards at any time in accordance with this user agreement and your card agreement.\nYour issuer determines the value of rewards redeemed through PayPal and available redemption methods (e.g., to pay for your purchase or for a statement credit).\nThere may be a delay between checkout and processing of your payment.\nOnly rewards available upon processing of your payment will be used.\nBecause your reward balance and/or transaction balance may change, whenever you request to redeem rewards for a purchase you also authorize PayPal to charge up to the full payment amount to your associated card if that happens.\nFor more information on redeeming rewards and how it works, please see About Payment Methods.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Debit card processing <p>PayPal will process your debit or prepaid card funded transactions through either the ATM debit network or the Visa, MasterCard or Discover network.\nIf we process your debit or prepaid card through an ATM debit network, we may provide you with the opportunity to switch to a Visa, MasterCard or Discover network by changing your preferences for that debit or prepaid card through your PayPal account profile.<\/p> Loyalty Cards <p>If you use the PayPal application on your mobile phone, you may store loyalty card numbers or bar codes, where applicable, for certain sellers in your PayPal account.\nWhen you store your loyalty card numbers or bar codes in your PayPal account, you will earn any rewards, subject to the seller’s loyalty card terms and conditions, at the time you make your payment to the merchant by presenting the stored loyalty card number or bar code to the seller at the point of sale.\nIt is your responsibility to make sure you have entered your loyalty card information correctly and that you update it as necessary.\nIt is also your responsibility to ensure that you are receiving the rewards to which you are entitled.\nPayPal is not responsible for managing your loyalty card account by offering this service and any questions about your loyalty card or associated rewards program should be directed to the seller who offers the card.<\/p> PayPal’s Purchase Protection Program <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal’s Purchase Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Purchase Protection program.\nPayPal’s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal’s Purchase Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal’s Purchase Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn’t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn’t what you ordered (referred to as a “Significantly Not as Described” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Purchase Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <strong>\n<em>will not<\/em>\n<\/strong> qualify for a refund under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program for an Item Not Received claim, if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller’s physical store, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions, or<\/li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller’s description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as “new” but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn’t receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as “used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Purchase Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller’s store location, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government agency.<\/li>\n<li>Stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal Payments.<\/li>\n<li>Payments sent using PayPal to any bill payment service.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay or guest checkout transactions (i.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account).<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Transaction eligibility for PayPal’s Purchase Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Purchase Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment and follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you’re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> to pursue a claim under our Purchase Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.\n<\/p>\n<p>Step 3: <strong>Respond to PayPal’s requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4: <strong>Comply with PayPal’s shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you’re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery means:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For transactions that total less than $750 U.S.\ndollars (or the currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or zip code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.<\/li>\n<li>For transactions that total $750 U.S.\ndollar (or the currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Signature confirmation currency thresholds

MXN<\/p>\n<p>U.S.\nDollar:<\/p>\n<p>750 USD<\/p>\n<p>Step 5: <strong>PayPal will make a final decision <\/strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don’t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Purchase Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can’t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we’ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won’t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).<\/p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller’s return policy.<\/p> Selling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services <p>&nbsp;<\/p> Receiving personal payments <p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.<\/li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you money using the “send money to a friend or family member.” If you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account’s ability to accept payments from friends or family members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> No surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Presentation of PayPal and Pay with Venmo <p>You must treat PayPal and/or Venmo as payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale where PayPal or Venmo branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal or Venmo services or marks.\n<\/p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal or Venmo services or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal or Venmo services.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or Venmo services or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal or Venmo, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising, and other customer communications) you agree to display the PayPal or Venmo services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Taxes and information reporting <p>Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “taxes”).\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process.\nFor example, PayPal is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of payments for goods and services you receive each calendar year into all of your PayPal accounts associated with the same tax identification number if you receive more than $20,000 in payments for good and services and process more than 200 transactions involving goods or services through those PayPal accounts in the same calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Your customer service information, refunds and returns policy, and privacy policy <p>You must publish customer service information with clear instructions on how your customers can contact you.\nSuch instructions must include at least: (1) one active customer service email address or active customer service URL to file tickets for assistance and/or (2) one active customer service telephone number.\nSuch information must be readily accessible for review by your customers.<\/p>\n<p>You must publish a refunds and returns policy.<\/p>\n<p>You must publish a privacy policy, where required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal's Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you about payment reviews by email and/or through your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer’s account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes intended for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions, you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace’s or the third party application’s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> PayPal Giving Fund <p>If you are a charity and hold a PayPal account, you may be eligible to participate in PayPal Giving Fund programs.\nPayPal Giving Fund is a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code as a tax-exempt public charity (Federal Tax ID: 45-0931286).\nIf you meet the eligibility requirements in the <strong>Nonprofit Certification Policy<\/strong> and are either a “Public Charity” under Section 509(a) of the Code or a \"Private Operating Foundation\" under IRS regulations, you may be automatically enrolled with PayPal Giving Fund upon acceptance of this user agreement.\nYou will receive an email from us confirming your enrollment.\nYour relationship with PayPal Giving Fund will be governed by the <strong>Nonprofit User Agreement<\/strong>, including receiving email communications from PayPal Giving Fund about its current and future partners about its programs.\nYou can opt out of email communications at any time in your <strong>PayPal Giving Fund profile<\/strong>.\nIf you don’t want to be enrolled or receive donations from PayPal Giving Fund, you can opt-out at any time by <strong>contacting us<\/strong>.\nFor more information, please see <strong>PayPal Giving Fund’s Policies<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a “card not present” transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Accepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer’s account through preauthorized transfers either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a “billing agreement,” \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"<\/p> If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers: <p>You must:<\/p>\n<p>You must not:<\/p>\n<p>Get each buyer’s prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.<\/p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer’s written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.<\/p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancelation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.<\/p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.<\/p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer’s option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.<\/p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the country of the buyer’s account or the currency of their card;<\/li>\n<li>whether you are registered as a charitable organization and have active 501(c)(3) status.\nYour 501(c)(3) status must be documented with PayPal to receive the rates applicable to charitable organizations, and those rates will apply only after you document your status with us.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Standard transaction fees <p>The fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Standard Transaction Fees table, with the fees applicable to charitable organizations founds on the Standard Transaction Fees for Charitable Organizations table for the charitable fees.\nPlease note that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 21 days’ advance notice for personal PayPal accounts and at least 5 days’ advance notice for business PayPal accounts of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.<\/li>\n<li>If you refund a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned.<\/li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Here or PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Micropayments fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the Micropayment Fees table will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of Standard Transaction Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal’s Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nYou may be able to choose to send payments to PayPal accounts, Venmo accounts, or both.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a business PayPal account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand<\/li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.<\/p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay service, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.<\/p>\n<p>You can send money through Payouts or Mass Pay even if your receiver does not have a PayPal or Venmo account, as applicable, using their email address or mobile number.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a relevant account, they can claim it by opening one.\nIf they don’t claim it, it will be refunded to you in thirty (30) days.\nPayPal is not liable for amounts sent by you in error.\nPayPal shall have no responsibility to reverse any payout payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Your responsibility to notify PayPal of pricing or fee errors <p>Once you have access to any account statement(s) or other account activity information made available to you by PayPal with respect to your business account(s), you will have ninety (90) days to notify PayPal in writing of any errors or discrepancies with respect to the pricing or other fees applied by PayPal.\nIf you do not notify PayPal within such timeframe, you accept such information as accurate, and PayPal shall have no obligation to make any corrections.\nFor the purposes of this provision, such pricing or fee errors or discrepancies are different than Unauthorized Transactions and other electronic transfer<strong> Errors<\/strong> which are each subject to different notification timeframes as set forth herein.<\/p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks <p>&nbsp;<\/p> General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account.\nIf a currency conversion is necessary (for example if the balance in your Cash Account or your business PayPal account for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, or if the buyer paid in a different currency), PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you refund a payment for goods or services, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned to you.\nThe amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Purchase Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.<\/li>\n<li>You lose a Venmo Protected Purchase Program claim.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.<\/li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven’t opted out).<\/li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer’s bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.<\/li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized<\/li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement or any other agreement between you and PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated or reversed for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of that payment may be calculated in that currency, using the PayPal transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) that applies at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account doesn’t cover the payment amount due plus the fees, we may use any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to cover the amount due.\nIf the payment methods linked to your PayPal account don’t cover the amount due, this will result in a negative balance.\nA negative balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your balance to resolve it.\nIf you don’t, PayPal may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover the amount due from you;<\/li>\n<li>take any or all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Dispute fees <p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> table, then the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> amount will be determined when the dispute case is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your dispute ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July, and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions<\/strong>.\nand all chargebacks from the buyer’s card issuer or reversals from the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>If your dispute ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.<\/p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s<strong> Resolution Center<\/strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal’s Seller Protection<\/strong> program.<\/li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a Standard Dispute fee.<\/li>\n<li>Decided in your favor by PayPal or your issuer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s<strong> Resolution Center<\/strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees<\/strong> may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.<\/p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Chargeback fees <p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, then PayPal will charge you a <strong>Chargeback fee<\/strong> for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee with apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.<\/p> The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee table and will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Chargeback fee<\/strong> table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal’s Purchase Protection program, Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program, and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection available to buyers in each of those countries.\nBuyers’ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about PayPal’s protection programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer’s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding user agreement.\nYou can find information on Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program in Venmo’s user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program in any country, or under Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay’s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What’s eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal’s Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal’s Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount for debit and credit card-funded transactions.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal’s Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an “Unauthorized Transaction” claim), and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by Paypal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They didn’t receive the item from you (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal’s Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal’s Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the United States.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for

details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a

valid proof of shipping and delivery.\n<ul>\n<li>The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person.\nprovided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Center.\nIf you

services from you using PayPal, your bank or credit card issuer, other impacted third parties or law enforcement about your actions;<\/li>\n<li>Update inaccurate information you provided us;<\/li>\n<li>Take legal action against you;<\/li>\n<li>If you’ve violated our Acceptable Use Policy, then you’re also responsible for damages to PayPal caused by your violation of this policy.\nor<\/li>\n<li>If you are a seller and you violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal's damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.\nYou acknowledge and agree that $2,500.00 U.S.\ndollars per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.\nPayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we close your PayPal account or terminate your use of the PayPal services for any reason, we’ll provide you with notice of our actions and make any unrestricted funds held in the balance of your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account or in the balance of your business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, available for withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by PayPal, any PayPal customer, or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this agreement, and/or your use of the PayPal services.<\/p> Holds, Limitations, and Reserves <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What are holds, limitations and reserves <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nUnless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we’ll provide you with notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these actions.\nTo request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Center or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.<\/p>\n<p>In order to facilitate PayPal’s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal’s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.<\/li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.<\/li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on PayPal’s risk decisions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe’ll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.<\/p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 21 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you’ve uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 21 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we’ll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved (but no longer than 180 days).<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds related to Marketplace transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third party directly.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on disputed transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we’ll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we’ll remove the funds from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we’ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.<\/li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you’ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Reserves placed on business PayPal accounts <p>We may place a reserve on your business PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your business PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your business PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the money in your business PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your business PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your business PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve<\/strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve<\/strong> is a specific minimum amount of money that you’re required to keep available in the balance of your business PayPal account at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, the funds will be shown as \"pending\" and we’ll notify you of the terms of the reserve.<br> If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you of the new terms.<br>\n<\/p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place longer than 180 days.<\/p> PayPal User Agreement Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is an Unauthorized Transaction <p>An “Unauthorized Transaction” occurs when money is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction <p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Reporting an Unauthorized Transaction <p>If you believe your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen, please contact PayPal customer service immediately or call: (888) 221-1161 or write: PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.<\/p>\n<p>Tell us AT ONCE if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using your login information or by other means.\nYou could lose all the money in your PayPal account.\nIf you tell us within 60 days after we provide you your PayPal account statement showing transfers you did not make, you will be eligible for 100% protection for Unauthorized Transactions.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if your PayPal account statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made with your PayPal login information or by other means, tell us at once.\nIf you do not tell us within 60 days after we provided the statement to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.\nIf a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods.<\/p> Error Resolution <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is an Error <p>An “Error” means the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When money is either incorrectly taken from your PayPal account or incorrectly placed into your PayPal account, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>An incorrect amount is credited to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.<\/li>\n<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You request receipt or periodic statement documents that PayPal is required to provide to you.<\/li>\n<li>You request information concerning preauthorized (recurring) transfers to your PayPal account that PayPal is required to provide to you.<\/li>\n<li>You request additional information or clarification concerning a transfer to or from your PayPal account, including a request you make to determine whether an error has occurred.<\/li>\n<li>You inquire about the status of a pending transfer to or from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You request documentation or other information, unless the request is for a duplicate copy for tax or other record-keeping purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered an Error <p>The following are NOT considered Errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Routine inquiries about the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Requests for duplicate documentation or other information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> In case of Errors or questions about your electronic transfers <p>Telephone us at (888) 221-1161, contact us through the PayPal Resolution Center.\nor write us at PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.\n<\/p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name and account number (if any).<\/li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.<\/li>\n<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.<\/p>\n<p>We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly.\nIf we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, we will credit your PayPal account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nFor new PayPal accounts, we may take up to 20 Business Days to credit your PayPal account for the amount you think is in error.<\/p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.<\/p> Processing Errors <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover.\nIf the error results in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You receiving less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.<\/li>\n<li>You receiving more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.<\/li>\n<li>Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: <ul>\n<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;<\/li>\n<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/li>\n<li>the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Processing errors are not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.<\/li>\n<li>Delays based on a payment review.<\/li>\n<li>Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.<\/li>\n<li>Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount of money that you are sending).<\/li>\n<\/ul> Remittance Transfer Errors <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is a Remittance Transfer <p>You may be protected for certain errors when you send money using a PayPal account outside of the U.S.\nA “Remittance Transfer” is a transaction that meets the following criteria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The payment is sent from a personal PayPal account that is used primarily for personal, family or household purposes,<\/li>\n<li>The payment is made for personal, family or household purposes,<\/li>\n<li>The payment is made using the send money feature through your PayPal account,<\/li>\n<li>The payment amount equals or exceeds $15 USD (excluding fees charged to you) or the foreign currency equivalent calculated using exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction, and<\/li>\n<li>The recipient of the payment has a PayPal account in a country outside the U.S.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Payments that you make at a merchant website or location by selecting PayPal as a payment option are not “Remittance Transfers.”<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What qualifies as a Remittance Transfer Error <p>A <strong>“Remittance Transfer Error”<\/strong> occurs if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You paid an incorrect amount to send the Remittance Transfer.\nFor example, you were charged more than the total shown on the remittance transfer receipt you received (unless the total shown on the receipt was an estimate, and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes).<\/li>\n<li>PayPal made a computational or bookkeeping error, such as a miscalculation of the amount the recipient received.<\/li>\n<li>The amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt was not made available to the recipient, unless: <ul>\n<li>we stated in the remittance transfer receipt that we used estimates and the difference in the amount received and the amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, or<\/li>\n<li>the problem was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside our control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Funds were available to the recipient later than the date of availability that was disclosed to you on the remittance transfer receipt or were not delivered, unless: <ul>\n<li>extraordinary circumstances outside our control caused the delay, and we could not reasonably anticipate those circumstances,<\/li>\n<li>delays resulted from fraud screenings, or were caused by requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Controls or similar requirements, or<\/li>\n<li>you (or someone assisting you) made the transfer with fraudulent intent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>You request documentation or information concerning the Remittance Transfer, such as information required to determine if a Remittance Transfer Error occurred.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered a Remittance Transfer Error <p>The following are NOT considered Remittance Transfer Errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An inquiry about the status of a Remittance Transfer, except where the funds from the transfer were not made available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability,<\/li>\n<li>A request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes,<\/li>\n<li>A change requested by the designated recipient, or<\/li>\n<li>A change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the

Disclaimer of Warranty and Release <p>&nbsp;<\/p> No warranty <p>\n<strong>The PayPal services are provided “as-is” and without any representation or warranty, whether express, implied or statutory.\nPayPal specifically disclaims any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>PayPal does not have any control over the products or services provided by sellers who accept PayPal as a payment method, and PayPal cannot ensure that a buyer or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so.\nPayPal does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the PayPal services, and operation of our websites, software, or systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control.\nPayPal will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and check issuances are processed in a timely manner but PayPal makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the PayPal services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or the U.S.\nor international mail service.\nSome states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Release of PayPal <p>If you

otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.<\/p> Agreement to Arbitrate <p>You and PayPal agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us will be resolved in accordance with the Agreement to Arbitrate provisions set forth below.\nPlease read this information carefully.\nAmong other things it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Affects your rights and will impact how claims you and we have against each other are resolved.<\/li>\n<li>Includes a Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief pursuant to which you agree to waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit against us.<\/li>\n<li>Requires you to follow the Opt-Out Procedure to opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a written notice and the opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If a dispute arises between you and PayPal, acting as either a buyer or a seller, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns.\nIf we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, we aim to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.\nDisputes between you and PayPal regarding the PayPal services may be reported to customer service online through the PayPal Help Center at any time, or by calling (888) 221-1161 from Mon-Fri 5:00 AM to 10:00 PM PT and Sat-Sun 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM PT.<\/p> Agreement to Arbitrate <p>\n<strong>\n<em>Our Agreement<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and PayPal each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal, including without limitation federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\nThis Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em> Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and PayPal agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.\nUnless both you and PayPal agree otherwise, the arbitrator(s) may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding.\nAlso, the arbitrator(s) may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s).\nAny relief awarded cannot affect other PayPal customers.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Arbitration Procedures<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.\nHowever, the arbitrator(s) can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.\nThe arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of this user agreement as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator(s) to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (referred to as the \"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other party, by certified mail, a completed Notice of Dispute.\nYou should send this notice to PayPal at: PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.\nPayPal will send any notice to you to the address we have on file associated with your PayPal account.\nit is your responsibility to keep your address up to date.\nAll information called for in the notice must be provided including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.<\/p>\n<p>If you and PayPal are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, you or PayPal may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nA form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at www.adr.org.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or PayPal may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and PayPal subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.\nIn cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or PayPal may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator(s) require otherwise.\nAny settlement offer made by you or PayPal shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator(s).<\/p>\n<p>The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PayPal customers, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PayPal customer to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Costs of Arbitration<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, PayPal will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.\nAny request for payment of fees by PayPal should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and PayPal will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, PayPal will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator(s) deem necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive.\nIn the event the arbitrator(s) determine the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse PayPal for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by PayPal on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Severability<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\nIf a court decides that any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in court.\nAll other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall be arbitrated under its terms.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Opt-Out Procedure<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a new PayPal customer, you can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice.\nThe opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time.\nYou must mail the opt-out notice to PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.<\/p>\n<p>For your convenience, we are providing an opt-out notice form you must complete and mail to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nYou must complete this form by providing all the information it calls for, including your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the PayPal account(s) to which the opt-out applies.\nYou must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective.\nThis procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the user agreement will continue to apply.\nOpting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.<\/p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Future Amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate<\/i>\n<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision in the user agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against PayPal prior to the effective date of the amendment.\nThe amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by this Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal.\nWe will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on www.paypal.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing notice through email.\nIf you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your PayPal account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.<\/p> Intellectual Property

PayPal User Agreement PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT About Your Account <p>This user agreement will be effective for all users as of September 14, 2020.\n<\/p> Welcome to PayPal!<p>These are the terms and conditions of the contract between you and PayPal (Europe) S.a r.l.\net Cie, S.C.A.\n(“PayPal”) governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services, which we call our user agreement.\nIt applies only to PayPal accounts of residents of Netherlands.\nIf you are an individual, you must be at least 18 years old and have full legal capacity to enter into a contract to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be registered in Netherlands.<\/p>\n<p>To use the PayPal services you need to open a PayPal account.\nBy opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nYou also agree to comply with the following additional documents and each of the other documents on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees page<\/li>\n<li>Privacy Statement<\/li>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>All future changes notified in the Policy Update already published on the “Legal Agreements” page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement and each of the other documents that apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may revise this user agreement and any of the documents listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide notice to you of at least two months.\nBy continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement take effect, you agree to be bound by those changes.\nIf you do not agree with any changes, you may close your account before the changes take effect.<\/p> Information about us and our service<p>PayPal’s main business is the issuance of electronic money and the provision of payment services using that electronic money.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about us and our service, you can read our Key Payment and Service Information.<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement, together with other legal terms and legally required disclosures relating to your use of our service will be made available to you at all times on the PayPal website (typically located on the “Legal Agreements” page).\nWe may also send this information to you.<\/p>\n<p>You may request a copy of any legally required disclosures (including this user agreement and the Key Payment and Service Information) from us and we will provide this to you in a form which allows you to store and reproduce the information (for example, by e-mail).\n<\/p> Opening an account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.<\/p>Personal accounts<p>With a personal account you can send and request money from friends and family and pay online for purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Holders of certain existing personal accounts may be required to upgrade their accounts (which may include providing further information to PayPal) in order to be able to use all of the current functionality available in a personal account.\n<\/p>\n<p>To use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you must open a business account or convert your personal account to a business account.<\/p>Business accounts <p>Business accounts are for people and organisations (whether incorporated or not) that primarily use PayPal to receive online payments for sales or donations.<\/p>\n<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.\nSee our Fees for further details.<\/p>\n<strong>\n<p>By opening a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\n<\/p>\n<\/strong> Commercial Entity Status <p>If the activity through your business account reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to Commercial Entity Agreements directly with our processing partners to allow you to continue accepting card-funded payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf in addition to this user agreement.\n<\/p> Safe use of your PayPal account <p>You should take reasonable steps to stop your PayPal account being misused.\nYou must maintain adequate security and control of any and all devices, items, IDs, passwords and personal identification numbers / codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nPlease see our Key Payment and Service Information for guidelines.\n<\/p>\n<p>You must comply with all reasonable instructions we may issue regarding how you can keep your Payment Instrument safe.<\/p>\n<p>We may require you to authenticate any instruction relating to your account (i.e.\ngive us the information that we need to be sure that it’s you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information – this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your instruction.<\/p>\n<p>You must keep your postal address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p>\n<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.\nIn some cases you can do this when logged into your account – in other cases you can do this directly with the third party.\nYou acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your Account to this third party.<\/p>\n<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;<\/li>\n<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.\nYou are liable to us for the actions that you authorise the third parties to carry out.\nYou will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>\n<strong>You can close your account at any time.<\/strong> See the PayPal Help Centre for how to do this.<\/p>\n<p>We may close your account at our convenience by providing you with two months’ prior notice.\nWe may also close your account at any time if:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>you are in breach of this user agreement and/or we are otherwise entitled to close your account under this user agreement;<\/li>\n<li>you do not access your account for three years.\nor<\/li>\n<li>we suspect that your account has been accessed without your authorisation.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Where we decide to close your account we will provide you with notice of account closure and where practicable, the reasons for closing your account, together with the ability to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.<\/p>\n<p>When your account is closed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>this user agreement terminates immediately, except that this user agreement survives termination to the extent and for so long as we require to deal with the closure of your account and to comply with applicable laws and regulations;<\/li>\n<li>we may cancel any pending transactions and you will forfeit any balances associated with special funding arrangements;<\/li>\n<li>we may suspend, limit or terminate your access to or use of our services, websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the services;<\/li>\n<li>you will remain liable for all outstanding obligations under this user agreement related to your account prior to closure;<\/li>\n<li>we may keep your account information in our database for the purpose of fulfilling our legal obligations.\nand<\/li>\n<li>we may retain your electronic money after closure to the extent and for the time we reasonably require to protect us and/or any third party against the risk of reversals, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities of whatever nature.\nAfter this time you will be able to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.\nPlease Contact Us if you have any questions about funds held in your account on closure.<br>\n<strong>If you are the legal representative of an incapacitated or deceased account holder, please Contact Us for assistance.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the event that we decide to discontinue any of our services or any portion or feature of our services for any reason, we will give you at least two months prior notice before discontinuing the service or feature, unless we determine in good faith that: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the service or feature must be discontinued sooner as required by law or a third-party relationship.\nor <\/li>\n<li>doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Linking and Unlinking a Funding Source <p>All money in your account is legally termed “electronic money”, which is recognised throughout the European Economic Area as a form of money suitable for use online.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can use a funding source as a way to pay us to obtain electronic money in your account or to receive withdrawals from your account, as further outlined in this user agreement (see in particular Adding or Withdrawing Money and Funding your Payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card, a prepaid card (where available) a bank account or PayPal Credit (where available) to your PayPal account as a funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may limit the availability of your funding sources to manage our risk.<\/p>\n<p>Please keep your funding source information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third-party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may contact your issuer to request this or remove your funding source from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your funding source, we will keep any preference setting attached to that funding source.\nYou may choose to confirm your card or bank account, so that we can verify that the card or bank account is valid and that you are its owner.\nWe may allow you to do this by following the Link and Confirm Card process (for cards) or the Bank Confirmation process (for bank accounts) or other processes which we may notify to you or which we may publish from time to time.<\/p>Your continuous permission for us to charge your funding sources <p>By linking a funding source to your PayPal account, you give us continuous permission to automatically charge that funding source (subject to this user agreement and the terms of any mandate (e.g.\nbank direct debit) used by the provider of that funding source to set up and maintain that authority) for the required value of the electronic money:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>to cover the payment amount (plus all transaction fees payable to us) when you use your account to send a payment to another user.\nand<\/li>\n<li>to top up your account when you use the Add Funds functionality account interface.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may charge the funding source again if the previous attempt failed.\nIf you cancel any continuous permission from your funding source, you will reimburse us for the value of any electronic money we’ve already issued for which a charge from that funding source remains outstanding.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can stop the permission by unlinking the funding source from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>SEPA is an initiative of the European Commission and European banking sector, aimed at making transactions more efficient within the European Union.\nWhenever you register a bank account with PayPal or use a new bank account for the first time as a Funding Source, you grant PayPal a SEPA Direct Debit mandate.\nIf you use a SEPA Direct Debit mandate for the continuous authority:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can access the mandate and the mandate reference number (MRN) in your PayPal account profile at any time and cancel or change the mandate for future transactions.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal will inform you of the amount of the SEPA Direct Debit payment and the time frame in which PayPal will collect the amount from the bank account together with the purchase confirmation.\nIf PayPal resubmits any SEPA Direct Debit payment request due to reversal of the original payment, there will be no (additional) information given on the amount and the time frame ahead of the resubmission.<\/li>\n<li>you can claim a refund from your bank at any time up to 8 weeks after the date on which the SEPA Direct Debit payment took place in accordance with your bank’s terms and conditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Risk of reversals to your funding source and when eCheques may arise <p>When we receive a payment from your funding source we may store the resulting electronic money in your reserve account for as long as we have reason to believe that there is risk of reversal by the funding source provider.\nThis is because we do not have all the information necessary to place the funds from your payment at your disposal in your PayPal balance while there is such a risk of reversal.\n<\/p>\n<p>When you instruct us to make a payment from your account to another user funded by a payment from your bank account and we store the resulting electronic money in this way, we call this type of payment from your bank account an “eCheque” payment.\nSee Funding payments you send from your account below for how we use eCheques.<\/p> Holding and using a PayPal balance <p>You will not receive interest or any other earnings on the money in your account.\nThis is because the money in your account is electronic money and European law forbids paying interest on electronic money.\nAlso, electronic money is not a deposit or an investment under Luxembourg law, so the Luxembourg deposit guarantee or investor indemnity schemes administered by the <i>Conseil des Protection des Deposants et des Investisseurs<\/i> cannot protect you.<\/p>\n<p>We may store and move the money in your account in and between:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the PayPal balance.\nand <\/li>\n<li>the reserve account, <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>at any given time subject further to this user agreement.<\/p>PayPal balance <p>The operational part of your account contains your PayPal balance, which is the balance of money available for payments or withdrawals.\n<\/p>\n<p>When you use our payment service to pay another user, you instruct us to transfer the money from your PayPal balance to the recipient’s account.\n<\/p>\n<p>You need to have enough PayPal balance in cleared funds to cover the amount of any payment you make and the transaction fees you owe us at the time of the payment.\nOther requirements also apply – see the section Making a Payment below.\nIf you have insufficient PayPal balance or have chosen a preferred funding source you are also requesting us to obtain funds on your behalf from your applicable funding source and issue electronic money to your PayPal balance for your payment to be made.<\/p>\n<p>When you withdraw your money you need to have enough PayPal balance to cover the value of any withdrawal at the time of the withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>See Adding or Withdrawing Money to know how to get a PayPal balance and how to withdraw it.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal balance shows a negative amount, this is the net amount you owe to us at the given time.\n<\/p> Reserve account <p>Money marked in your account overview as “pending”, “uncleared”, “held” or otherwise restricted or limited at any given time is held in the part of your account which acts as a reserve account.\nYou cannot access and use money stored in the reserve account.<\/p> Adding or Withdrawing Money Adding money <p>To get electronic money into your account you can, subject further to this user agreement:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>accept a payment in your account from someone else.\nWe may charge you fees for this.\nor<\/li>\n<li>obtain electronic money from us by paying us an equivalent amount.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can obtain electronic money from us by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>automatically using your applicable funding source(s) to cover the amount of the payments that you instruct us to send to other users (and the transaction fees payable by you to us)..\nor<\/li>\n<li>manually using the “Add Funds” function available from your account interface to pay us or instructing us to charge your funding source for the electronic money.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The execution of any payment to us from your funding source provider is your funding source provider’s legal responsibility.\nWe have no control over how long the payment to us will take.<\/p>Withdrawing money <p>If you have a PayPal balance, you may withdraw any amount by transferring it to your nominated funding source linked to your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nThis could include your bank account or debit or credit card, depending on the country in which your PayPal account is registered.<\/p>\n<p>When you instruct us to withdraw any amount of your PayPal balance, subject further to this user agreement we will:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>convert the electronic money to money that we can transfer to your nominated funding source.\nand <\/li>\n<li>instruct our own bank to transfer that money to your nominated funding source.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We aim to send the withdrawal payment instruction to our bank by the end of the next Business Day (“Business Day” means a day on which banks in Luxembourg are open to the general public).\nif there are no other delays subject to this user agreement.\nOnce our bank receives our payment instruction, we have no control over how long the payment to you will take to complete.\nAt this point, our bank, your funding source provider and the payment systems that they rely on take over responsibility for getting the money to your nominated funding source and this can affect the time it takes for you to receive your money.\nWe may allow you to withdraw the money by transferring the money to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an eligible bank account (where we make this available) through: <ul>\n<li>a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your account (this withdrawal/redemption functionality is sometimes known as “transfer to bank”).\nor<\/li>\n<li>an Instant Transfer to your bank account linked to your account.\n<br>\n<br> We may allow the above transfers to be made through the debit card attached to that bank account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>your branded MasterCard or Visa card (where we make this available).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Fees apply to withdrawals.\nWe will also disclose to you the fees in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>The funding source (for example, bank account or card) into which you request the withdrawal must be denominated in the original opening currency of your account or another currency that PayPal supports for withdrawals in your country of residence.<\/p>\n<p>You may only withdraw PayPal balance in the opening currency of your account, unless we agree otherwise.\nIn order to withdraw PayPal balance held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nOur transaction exchange rate will be used.<\/p>\n<p>This means that if you withdraw:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal balance held in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into your original opening currency.\nand<\/li>\n<li>to a funding source (for example, bank account or card) denominated in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into the currency in which the funding source is denominated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To protect you, our other users and us from loss and to allow us to comply with our anti-money laundering and other legal obligations, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorised the withdrawal or if payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview) to lift your withdrawal limit.<\/p> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies <p>When you open your account, it is configured for use with the opening currency of your account.\n<\/p>\n<p>The opening currency of your account is Euro (EUR).\n<\/p>\n<p>We may configure your account further so that you can use it to store money and send and receive payments in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nIf you hold a PayPal balance, we may allow you to convert it to balance in another currency.\n<\/p>\n<p> If your PayPal balance is not enough to cover the amount of a payment you instruct us to make in a particular currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall.\nThere may be some restrictions on where you can send payments in certain currencies.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may allow you to choose the way in which your account treats and/or converts payments received in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nTo receive money in a currency other than the opening currency of your account, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n<\/p>\n<p> Payments in certain currencies can only be received by automatic conversion of the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you receive a payment from anyone who doesn’t have a PayPal account and that payment is in a currency which your account is not currently configured to use, we may automatically convert the amount received into a currency that your account is configured to use at the time the payment is made.\n<\/p>\n<p> Please see the Withdrawing Money section above to see how withdrawals in different currencies can be made.\n<\/p>\n<p> If one of the currency balances in your account shows that you owe us an amount of funds for any reason, we may set off the amount you owe us by using funds you maintain in a different currency balance or by deducting amounts you owe us from money you receive into your account, or money you attempt to withdraw or send from your account, or in a different account, and by deducting funds from any withdrawals you attempt to make.\nIf, for a period of 21 Days, you have a PayPal balance that reflects an amount owing to us that is not in Euros, we may convert the amount you owe us to Euros.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.\nYou are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that we determine is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nWe may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.\n<\/p>How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\n<\/p>\n<p> The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).\n<\/p>\n<p> We may make a transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) available for your review during your transaction.\nIf you complete the transaction, that transaction exchange rate may apply to the payment for the transaction whenever it is processed.\nor that rate may be valid only if the payment for that transaction is processed within a limited time, as stated during the transaction.\nAfter that limited time, we may use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the transaction is processed, or not perform the currency conversion.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you have authorised a payment under a billing agreement, and we perform currency conversion for that payment, we will use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the payment transaction is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment under a billing agreement may vary.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may provide you access to a “Currency Converter” tool to see what transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) may apply for certain currency conversions.\nAny rates shown using the Currency Converter tool only apply at the time you use the tool and are subject to change.<\/p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorise us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\n<\/p>\n<p> You may have the right to have your card issuer convert the currency of the card payment into the currency in which you send the payment from your PayPal account, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether we or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.\n<\/p>\n<p> PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use existing balance or your linked bank account is the funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p> If PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup funding source to be chosen, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on the payment from your backup funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p> Where a currency conversion is offered at the point of sale by the merchant, not by PayPal, and you choose to authorise the payment transaction on the basis of the merchant's exchange rate and charges, PayPal has no liability to you for that currency conversion.\n<\/p> Account Statements and Requesting Account Records <p>Unless your Account is restricted you may view and download your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou agree to review your transactions through your PayPal account history instead of receiving periodic statements by email.\n<\/p>\n<p>Key information relating to your payments will be provided to you via e-mail and your transaction history will also be updated and made available to you at any time by logging into your account.\nYou can also access a downloadable report from your PayPal account.\nThis will show all fees incurred and any other amounts charged to your PayPal account in the relevant period.\nThe report will only be updated and made available if there has been any activity on your PayPal account or any fees have been incurred in the relevant period.\nThe way in which we provide the transaction information will allow you to store and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy.\n<\/p>\n<p> We reserve the right to charge a fee for providing you with additional information or for providing the transaction history and other information about fees in a different way but we won’t charge you for records requested in connection with your good-faith assertion of an error in your PayPal account.<\/p> Fees <p> We charge fees for our services as set out on the fees page.\n<\/p>\n<p> Quoted fees are inclusive of all applicable taxes.\nhowever, other taxes or costs may exist that are not paid through or imposed by us.\n<\/p>\n<p> You are liable for telephone charges and any charges made by your internet service provider or similar or associated charges as a result of the use by you of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may deduct our fees from your PayPal balance.\nWe may deduct our transaction-related fees from the amounts we transfer before those funds are credited to your PayPal balance.\n<\/p>\n<p> We will provide you with the details of the amounts you receive and our fees charged either by e-mail or in your transaction history (which you can access by logging into your account).\n<\/p>\n<p> If your payment requires you to pay a fee to us, we may disclose that fee to you when you provide your payment instruction to us.\n<\/p>\n<p> You cannot set off or deduct any amounts from our fees.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may make a charge for any additional services we provide outside this user agreement.\nWe will tell you of those charges when you ask for the service.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a merchant and you wish to apply for (and retain) our volume-based tiered merchant rate, the terms of the merchant rate in the Receiving Payments section below apply.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nMaking A Payment General provisions for making a payment Your payment instruction <p>We may allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in any way which we may notify to you from time to time.\nThe way in which you provide your payment instruction can depend on the type of payment you are making – for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are paying for a purchase or making a donation, many sellers and/or fund collectors allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in a dedicated PayPal checkout or other PayPal payment collection integration on their site.<\/li>\n<li>You can use the “Send Money” feature when you log into your PayPal account to send a payment to someone.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> We may require you to authenticate your instruction (i.e.\ngive us the information that we need to be sure that it’s you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information – this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your payment instruction.\n<\/p> Cancelling your payment instruction <p> Once you provide you payment instruction to us, you may not cancel it, except if it is a payment instruction under a billing agreement (see below for more details).\n<\/p> How long will my payment take? <p>Your payment to another user will leave your account [within the Business Day] after we receive your complete payment instruction.<\/p>\n<p>The payment will leave your account within two Business Days if we receive your complete payment instruction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>on a day which is not a Business Day.\nor<\/li>\n<li>after the following local cut off times on a Business Day for accounts registered in the following countries: 4pm in Netherlands.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may allow you to ask us to make your payment on a specific later date, in which case your payment will leave your account on that later date.<\/p>\n<p>Other provisions in this user agreement may cause the above timeframes to be extended.<\/p>When we may refuse to make your payment <p>We may treat your payment instruction as not complete and we may refuse to make your payment if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you do not have enough money in your PayPal balance.\n<\/li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that your linked funding sources do not have sufficient funds to cover the money required to make your payment;<\/li>\n<li>you do not provide us with all mandatory information requested in the relevant payment or checkout flows which we use to obtain your payment instructions (for instance, sufficient details of the recipient as we may request and authentication of your payment instruction);<\/li>\n<li>the payment exceeds the sending limit we tell you about when you try to make the payment.\nor<\/li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that a restricted activity has happened in relation to your account or you are otherwise in breach of this user agreement.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> When your payment is not accepted by the recipient <p> If we allow you to send a payment to someone who does not have a PayPal account, the recipient can claim the money by opening a PayPal account.\n<\/p>\n<p> If the recipient already has a PayPal account, they can refuse to accept the money.\n<\/p>\n<p> If the recipient refuses to accept the money or doesn’t open a PayPal account and claim the money within 30 days after the date it is sent, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to your PayPal account.\nSee Refunds to your account for what can happen when your PayPal account receives a refund.\n<\/p> Sending limits <p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can make, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nTo lift your sending limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).<\/p> Setting up automatic charges from your account Seller delayed payments <p> When you pay certain sellers or pay for certain purchases (for instance, purchases which have to be shipped to you or may be updated and finalised by the seller), you are providing: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an authorisation to the seller to collect your payment at a later time.\nand<\/li>\n<li>an instruction to us to automatically pay that seller when the seller requests payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> Your authorisation will typically remain valid for up to 30 days, but may remain valid for longer.\nIf you have balance, we may hold the payment amount as pending until the seller collects your payment.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied (as described in the Currency Conversion section) at the time the payment is processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> Your authorisation allows the seller to update the payment amount before the seller collects the payment (to account for any changes to the purchase that you may agree with the seller, such as additional taxes, shipping or postage charges or discounts).\nWe are not required to verify any changes at any time (including at the time the payment is transferred).\nWe may transfer any amount on the basis of your authorisation and upon receiving instructions from the seller of the final payment amount.\n<\/p> Billing agreement payments <p> You can use a billing agreement to manage payments to the same recipient(s) on an ongoing automatic basis.\nWhen you enter into a billing agreement:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>you authorise the named recipient(s) to collect payments from your account as the recipient determines (this could be for payments of amounts you owe the recipient for a purchase of goods or services under a separate contract that you have with the recipient).\nand<\/li>\n<li>you instruct PayPal to pay the named recipient(s) (or other recipient(s) that the named recipient(s) direct(s)) when the named recipient(s) request(s) PayPal to make your payment.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This makes the recipient a “trusted beneficiary” (the legal term for someone you tell us is a trusted recipient) of all your payments made under that billing agreement, so we will not normally ask you to authenticate (e.g.\nlog in) or approve these payments when they are made.\n<\/p>\n<p> Payments made under the billing agreement may be in variable amounts and may be made on various dates.\nWe are only a payment service provider so we can’t (and please don’t expect us to) know what you have or haven’t agreed with the recipient or to know why the recipient decided to collect your payment.\nWe are not obliged to verify or confirm the amount the recipient presents to us for the purpose of processing payments made under the billing agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> We use several names for payments that can be managed by a billing agreement – these include “automatic payments,” \"subscription payments\" \"recurring payments” “reference transactions” \"preauthorised transfers\" or \"preapproved payment.\" <\/p>\n<p> You can cancel your billing agreement at any time with immediate effect in your account interface or by contacting us.\nWhere a payment under that billing agreement is scheduled to be made before the end of the next Business Day after you tell us to cancel it, we may cancel your billing agreement after that payment has been made.\nIf you cancel a billing agreement, you may still owe the recipient money for goods or services that you have received but have not paid for.\n<\/p>\n<p> If we determine currency conversion is necessary for a billing agreement payment, and we perform the conversion, we will use the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the payment is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment transaction may vary.\n<\/p> Refunds to your account How refunds can happen <p> We may allow the recipient of your payment to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>refuse to accept it.\nor<\/li>\n<li>decide to accept it and then use our service to send you a refund of all or any part of the amount of the payment later.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> We will return the amount of any refused payment or refunded payment to your Balance.\nWe will return the amount of an unclaimed payment to your balance within 30 days after the date you initiated the payment.\nIf any amount of any payment is returned to you in any of the ways outlined above, we may convert the returned amount for you into either: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the currency of the balance you used for the original payment (before any conversion into the currency received by the recipient happened);<\/li>\n<li>the opening currency of your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>US dollars (opening a balance in that currency for you, if you don’t have one already).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the original payment you sent involved a currency conversion we will convert the returned amount from the currency received by the recipient as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the amount is returned within 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable on the date of the original payment, so that you receive the original amount (including the currency conversion fee you paid) in the original currency you converted for the original payment.\nand<\/li>\n<li>if the amount is returned after 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of the conversion of the returned amount.\nYou agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Unless otherwise outlined above in this section, you agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments when you convert any amount returned to you in the ways outlined above.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may also automatically withdraw the returned amount from your Balance and transfer the funds back to the funding source you used for the original payment.\nWithdrawals can also involve a currency conversion – see the section on Withdrawing money above.\n<\/p>Risks when receiving refunds <p> The returned amount could be lower in value than your original payment amount.\nThis can happen as a result of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the recipient sending you a refund lower in value than your original payment amount.\nAs we are only a payment service provider, we cannot know what you are entitled to from the original payment recipient as a refund or why the recipient sent the refund in a particular amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>transaction exchange rate fluctuations.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal is not responsible for any loss resulting from the recipient's decision to refuse or refund your payment, except to the extent that a refund sent by the recipient is a payment executed incorrectly by PayPal <\/p>\n<p>We are not liable to you for the difference between the value of your original payment and the value of the resulting refund, except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).\n<\/p> Funding Your Payment Selecting a preferred funding source <p>You may select a preferred funding source when logged into your account.\nSubject to this user agreement, the preferred funding source will be used as the default funding source for payments you send from your account.<\/p>\n<p> You can set separate preferred funding sources for some billing agreement payments.\n<\/p> Special Funding Arrangements <p> Some payments can be funded by special funding arrangements linked to your PayPal account, such as merchant/transaction specific balance, gift vouchers or other promotional funding arrangements.\nThe use and priority of these special funding arrangements are subject to further terms and conditions between you and us.\nYour account overview may show the notional amount available in your special funding arrangements to fund qualifying payments at any given time.\nThis amount does not constitute electronic money, is not deemed part of your PayPal balance and is not redeemable in cash - it only represents the amount of electronic money which we offer to issue and credit to your account at the time of (and only to immediately fund) a qualifying payment, subject to (and only for the period outlined in) the further terms and conditions of use of that special funding arrangement.\nIf your payment funded by a special funding arrangement is reversed at a later time for any reason, we will keep the amount that represents the portion of that payment that was funded by your special funding arrangement and (provided that the special funding arrangement has not already expired) reinstate the special funding arrangement.<\/p> Funding payments you send from your account <p> We will obtain electronic money for the payment you send from your account from the following sources in the following order to the extent they are available:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Special Funding Arrangements (if available for the given transaction)<\/li>\n<li>Preferred funding source (if selected and available)<\/li>\n<li>Pre-existing PayPal balance<\/li>\n<li>Bank account (instant transfer via bank mandate)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal Credit (where available)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal-branded debit card (where available)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal-branded credit card (where available)<\/li>\n<li>Debit card<\/li>\n<li>Credit card<\/li>\n<li>Bank account (eCheque) <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you have linked a bank account as a funding source we may choose to offer you access to Pay After Delivery, which allows you to defer a charge to this bank account for a period of time.\nIf you are offered and choose to use this service, the Pay After Delivery Terms will apply.<\/p> PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection.\nWhen applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection.\nPayPal’s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn’t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn’t what you ordered (referred to as a “Significantly Not as Described” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the PayPal Buyer Protection, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.<\/p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection.<\/p>Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>\n<strong>will not<\/strong>\n<\/em> qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not Received claim, if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller’s retail point of sale, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions or<\/li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller’s description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as “new” but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn’t receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as “used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal Buyer Protection <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats, except for personally portable light vehicles used for recreational purposes like bicycles and wheeled hoverboards.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms, as well as payments made on crowdlending platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller’s retail point of sale, , except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Payments to state-run bodies, (except for state-owned enterprises) or traders acting on mandates received from state-run bodies.<\/li>\n<li>Payment equivalent to cash, including stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal Payments.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay&nbsp.\ni.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made in respect of gold (whether in physical form or in exchange-traded form).<\/li>\n<\/ul> Transaction eligibility for PayPal Buyer Protection <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, then follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery related to such purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you’re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the&nbsp;<strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>&nbsp;to pursue a claim under our PayPal Buyer Protection.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within&nbsp;180 days&nbsp;of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal&nbsp;account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days&nbsp;after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nIf you are making an Item Not Received claim, PayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.<\/p>\n<p>Step 3:&nbsp;<strong>Respond to PayPal’s requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4:&nbsp;<strong>Comply with PayPal’s shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you’re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item&nbsp;back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide Proof of Delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Step 5:&nbsp;<strong>PayPal will make a final decision&nbsp;<\/strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p> Event tickets <p>In certain cases, if you purchase a ticket or pay for the right to attend an event from a payment recipient who is a UK registered PayPal account holder (“Event”), all monies paid by you may be held by PayPal on trust for you, so that the beneficial interest in such monies remains with you until the performance of the Event in question.<\/p>Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal’s Buyer Protection.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don’t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our PayPal Buyer Protection, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can’t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we’ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won’t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).<\/p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller’s return policy.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nReceiving Payments General provisions for receiving payments <p>PayPal may allow anybody (with or without an account) to make a payment resulting in the issuance or transfer of electronic money to your account.\n<\/p>\n<p>By integrating (including by having already integrated) into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>The receipt of a payment into your account does not equate to the receipt of cleared funds.\nA notification that a payment has been sent to you does not amount to a receipt of electronic money in your account unless you have accepted the payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may allow you to accept payments in any currency supported by our Service from time to time.\n<\/p>\n<p>Where you (instead of PayPal) offer the payer at the point of sale a currency conversion of an amount you receive through PayPal, you will inform the buyer of the exchange rate and any charges that will be applied to the payment transaction.\nPayPal has no liability to any buyer if you fail to inform the buyer of the exchange rate and charges.\nYou acknowledge that if you fail to disclose the exchange rate and charges to the buyer this may constitute a criminal offence by you.<\/p>\n<p>Any payment sent to you may be subject to a reversal, payment review, limitation, reserve or hold as allowed under this user agreement.\n<\/p>Receiving limits <p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can receive, including money you receive for purchases.\nTo lift your receiving limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).<\/p>\n<strong>New checkout solution included in the PayPal Commerce Platform<\/strong>\n<p>The PayPal Commerce Platform includes our new checkout solution.&nbsp.\nThe checkout solution consists of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>our dedicated bundled checkout capability in your online checkout/platform to enable a buyer with or without an account to send a payment to your account.\nand<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fraud Protection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may offer you all, any part or any combination of parts of the checkout solution.\nIf we offer you the checkout solution and you choose to use it, in addition to this user agreement, you agree to the following further terms relating to the following capabilities:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement<\/strong>, when you use our APM functionality as part of the checkout solution.\nand<\/li>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Online Card Payment Services Agreement<\/strong>, when you use: <ul>\n<li>our Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments as part of the checkout solution bundle.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Fraud Protection as part of the checkout solution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Our <strong>Fees<\/strong>&nbsp;for using the checkout solution apply.<\/p> Rules about surcharging <p>PayPal does not encourage surcharging because it is a commercial practice that can penalise the consumer and create unnecessary confusion, friction and abandonment at checkout.\n<\/p>\n<p>You may only surcharge for the use of our services in compliance with any law applicable to you and not in excess of the surcharges that you apply for the use of other payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>If you surcharge a buyer, you, and not we, will inform the buyer of the requested charge.\nWe are not liable to any buyer where you have failed to inform the buyer of any surcharge.\nYou acknowledge that you could be committing a criminal offence if you surcharge and/or fail to disclose any form of surcharge to a buyer.<\/p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal as a payment method or mark at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or substantially similar:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>logo placement,<\/li>\n<li>position within any point of sale,<\/li>\n<li>treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, or fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterise PayPal as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal.<\/p> Taxes and information reporting <p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nWe are not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.\nAs a bank service provider no sales tax applies to the PayPal services in the EU.<\/p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy.<\/p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace’s or the third party application’s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p>\n<p>We may allow you to authorise certain marketplaces to use your account to pay amounts you owe to the marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) arising from a claim under the terms of the marketplace’s own resolution process (“<strong>Marketplace Due Amounts<\/strong>”).\nIf you give such an authorisation and the marketplace notifies us of the claim, you instruct us to process payments of all and any Marketplace Due Amounts relating to that claim from your PayPal account to that marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) according to the marketplace’s instructions to us.\nWe may treat your instruction for the payment of any given Marketplace Due Amount as cancelled if we decide that the claim would have been determined in your favour had it been filed as a claim with us.\nYou can also cancel this instruction by contacting us.\nAll claims filed directly with the marketplace are governed by the marketplace’s own policy only.\nThe terms of the PayPal Seller Protection Programme do not cover you for claims filed by your buyers directly with the marketplace.<\/p> Accepting billing agreement payments <p>If we allow you to accept payments from a payer under a billing agreement, when you present to us a payment request under that billing agreement, you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>warrant to us that the amounts you present have been agreed and consented to by the payer whose account will be deducted (including changes to those amounts) and that you will give prior notice of the deduction to the payer.\nand<\/li>\n<li>agree that you will notify the payer at least 4 weeks in advance of the amount they will collect if that amount has increased in such a manner that the payer could not have reasonably expected to pay such an amount, taking into account the payer’s previous spending patterns and the circumstances of the payment and that you are liable to us for any refunds of that payment in accordance with the terms of this user agreement.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Refunds and reversals of payments <p>When you receive a payment, it could be refunded or reversed.\nWe may allow you to send to the payer a refund of the payment.\nWe may carry out a reversal of your payment in certain circumstances.\nSee the rest of this section for more details.<\/p>Refunds <p>You alone are (and PayPal is not) responsible for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>your legal and contractual obligations towards the payer for any amount you return to the payer.\nand<\/li>\n<li>any difference between the cost to the payer of making the original payment and the value of the amount returned to the payer (for instance, as a result of transaction exchange rate fluctuations) except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).<br>\n<br>See our fees for details of the fees you paid to us as the recipient of the original payment which we retain when you use the special commercial transaction refund functionality in your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nexcept to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).<\/li>\n<\/ul>Reversals <p>If you receive a payment in your account, you owe us the full amount of the payment and our losses arising from processing the payment.\nThis can include our liability (including any fees, charges and penalties) towards any third party (including the payer and the payer’s funding source provider).<\/p>\n<p>A reversal happens when we exercise our right to set off the above amounts from your account under the section Reimbursement for your liability in this user agreement.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount you owe us in that currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall and you will be charged for the currency conversion.\nThis means that, for example, if you are a seller, amounts of payments received in your account may be removed from your account after you have delivered any goods or services sold.<\/p>\n<p>A reversal can happen when:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we reimburse the payer in respect of a PayPal Buyer Protection claim the payer made against you.<\/li>\n<li>we compensate the payer or the payer’s funding source provider (or both) because we receive a claim from the payer or their funding source provider for the payment amount under the reversal process used by that funding source provider.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For instance:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the payer used a card to fund the payment to you the payer could pursue a “chargeback” with the card issuer.\nThe card issuer, not us, determines whether the payer is successful when they pursue a chargeback.\nYou can find out more about chargebacks by reviewing our Chargeback Guide, accessible via the PayPal Security Centre and the section called: “Selling Safely”.\nThe PayPal Security Centre is accessed via the PayPal website.\nWe charge you a fee for receiving a chargeback claim.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If the payer used a bank account to fund the payment the payer or the bank could pursue a bank reversal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The amount claimed may be greater than the original amount you received due to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the time of payment and the time of the claim.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we may have to compensate your payer when they claimed that there was a problem with their payment (including that their payment was unauthorised or incorrect or that their billing agreement payment was not expected) – see Resolving Problems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>we are entitled to carry out the reversal for any other reason under this user agreement, including the provision Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Impact of PayPal Buyer Protection on sellers <p> You should read our Buyer Protection Policy and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection made available by PayPal to buyers in each of those countries as buyers’ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about the PayPal Buyer Protection on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer’s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding PayPal Buyer Protection listed on that page or in the corresponding user agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under&nbsp;PayPal Buyer Protection&nbsp.\nin any country:<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back plus pay for return shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/p>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay’s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your cash account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nplace a&nbsp;hold&nbsp;on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor<\/p>\n<p>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/p> PayPal Seller Protection What’s eligible <p>If you have received more than €100,000 per month at least once over a consecutive period of 6 months on your PayPal Account and/or if you are applying surcharge for the use of PayPal (when the law applicable to you allows you to apply surcharge), you are not eligible for PayPal seller protection and this section applies to you unless otherwise agreed between you and PayPal.\nPayPal will review your eligibility for seller protection in October and April of each calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks,&nbsp;you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Seller Protection.\nWhen it applies, PayPal Seller Protection entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program<\/p>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an “Unauthorized Transaction” claim) and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They didn’t receive the item from you (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal Seller Protection as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various PayPal Buyer protection processes on sellers.<\/p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the Netherlands.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for items subject to the&nbsp;<strong>Intangible Goods Additional

the buyer paid for the transaction in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person, provided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the&nbsp;<strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.&nbsp;If you do not respond to PayPal’s request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>Provide proof of shipment or delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The payment must be marked \"eligible\" or \"partially eligible\" in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims for PayPal Seller Protection on the \"Transaction Details\" page.<\/li>\n<li>You must accept a single payment from one PayPal Account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Seller Protection program.\nPayPal will make a decision, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements, any information or documentation provided during the resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>Item Not Received additional requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection program for a buyer’s Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements&nbsp.\nlisted above and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked “eligible” for PayPal’s Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements<\/li>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third party or if you have a native app integration.<\/li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.<\/li>\n<li>If the transaction is a payment for digital goods or licenses for digital content, you must have paid Standard Transaction Fees on the sale (this does not apply to payments for other Intangible Goods).<\/li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of delivery for Intangible Goods.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as:<\/p>\n<p>Proof of shipment<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery<\/p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the Transaction Details page, or<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing

(based on the currency of the payment) listed in the&nbsp;<strong>signature confirmation threshold table<\/strong>.\nSignature confirmation is online documentation, viewable at the shipping company’s website, indicating that the item was signed for.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> Your choice of carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.\nPlease ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide ‘delivered’ status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of delivery for intangible goods:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>QR Code Transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of shipment or proof of delivery:<\/p>\n<p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.\nCompelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Received or accessed by the recipient<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For QR code transactions you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information to the

passed.<\/p>Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.&nbsp.\nWhen PayPal places a hold on a payment amount, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\n&nbsp;PayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include where we have reason to believe that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transactions are higher risk, this can be where the transaction involves the sale of goods or services in a high risk category, or other facts known to us typically resulting in an increased number of chargebacks, other claims or disputes or to be often involved in fraud or illegal activity;<\/li>\n<li>There is a sudden and abnormal change in a PayPal account holder’s selling activity including an increase in the number of chargebacks, reversals, or buyer complaints received in relation to such PayPal account;<\/li>\n<li>Any PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities;<\/li>\n<li>A PayPal account involved in the transaction may have been compromised, or that stolen financial details (bank or credit card) are used for the payment, or otherwise a transaction has not been properly authorised;<\/li>\n<li>A user is trying to send or withdraw funds they received fraudulently;<\/li>\n<li>A user has not provided sufficient Information to us to enable us to verify their identity or the identity of their business and/or the user has a limited trading history with PayPal;<\/li>\n<li>A payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer files a chargeback, reversal or PayPal Buyer Protection claim on a payment you received.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer files a claim under a marketplace's resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of reversal of funds in your account to your funding source.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).<\/li>\n<\/ul>Payment review <p>When we identify a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nThis may be because we have the reasonable suspicion that the payer’s PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities or for other reasons as determined by us in our reasonable discretion.&nbsp.\nThis may include where there is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).<\/p>\n<p>If a payment is subject to payment review, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>execute the payment order initiated by the buyer;<\/li>\n<li>in our discretion, immediately upon such execution restrict the payer’s account;<\/li>\n<li>place a hold on the payment [in the payer’s account].\nand/or<\/li>\n<li>notify the recipient to delay the delivery of the purchase paid for by the payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If we don’t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\n<p>All payments that complete payment review are still subject to being reversed under the terms of this user agreement but will be Seller Protection eligible if they meet the Seller Protection requirements.\nPayPal will provide notices to you by email and/or in the transaction history tab of your PayPal account.\nA payment subject to payment review is a review of the payment only and is implemented to reduce the risk of PayPal users receiving high risk transactions.\nA payment subject to payment review is neither a review nor a representation by PayPal as to the commercial dealings, character or reputation of a party to the payment transaction and should not be considered as a lessening of the respect of any person.<\/p>Holds related to your instructions <p>Certain PayPal functionality may allow you (whether directly or via someone you permit to act on your behalf, like an online marketplace platform on which you transact as a seller) to instruct us to hold your funds (including the proceeds of payments you receive using PayPal) in your reserve account.<\/p>\n<p>In such a case we will show you the availability status of those funds in your balance – the status descriptions may differ according to the functionality you used to instruct us to place the hold.\nWe will release the hold on the funds according to the instruction that you (or the entity that you have permitted to act on your behalf) give to us, subject to the rest of this user agreement.<\/p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice&nbsp;<strong>restricted activities<\/strong>, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.&nbsp.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including where we have reason to believe that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, then we’ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>Someone has used your card or bank account without your permission, for example if your debit or credit card issuer or bank alerts us to this.<\/li>\n<li>You have breached this user agreement or violated the&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>Your performance as a seller indicate your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you’ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities&nbsp;above).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also limit your PayPal account in order to comply with applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>Reserves <p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.&nbsp.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the funds in your PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A “rolling reserve”<\/strong>&nbsp;is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A “minimum reserve”<\/strong>&nbsp;is a specific minimum amount of funds that you’re required to keep available in your balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your PayPal account, the money will be moved to your reserve account and shown as “pending” and we’ll notify you about it.<\/p>\n<p>If we change the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you about it as well.<\/p>\n<p>You will undertake, at your own expense, any further action required to establish a reserve or other form of security in a manner reasonably determined by us.&nbsp.\nThis can involve executing any necessary documents and registering any form of document reasonably required by us to allow us to perfect any form of security interest.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nRESOLVING PROBLEMS <strong>\n<p>We strongly recommend that you monitor your account closely on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<\/strong> If you find a problem… <p>If you have any reason to believe that there is a problem with your account or our service, follow these steps:<\/p> Step 1: Take a few moments to identify the type of problem: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Unexpected billing agreement payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where you entered into a billing agreement but a payment was sent from your account to another PayPal account under that billing agreement where:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you didn’t agree with the recipient in advance the exact payment amount.\nand<\/li>\n<li>the payment amount ended up being more than you could reasonably have expected to pay based on previous charges and the other circumstances.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Incorrect payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where a payment sent from your account to another PayPal account was not sent as you specified when you asked us to make it (e.g.\nfor the wrong amount, delayed, wrong recipient) or you received such a payment.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Security / Fraud problem<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Unauthorised payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where a payment sent from your account wasn’t authorised by you (or anyone who’s authorised to make payments for you).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Another type of security / fraud problem<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where there was another security or fraud problem, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>there was some other unauthorised access to your account.<\/li>\n<li>your password or PIN was compromised.<\/li>\n<li>a device you have used to access our services was lost, stolen or deactivated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<br>\n<p>Follow the steps in the section “<strong>What to do in case of a security problem<\/strong>” in the <strong>\n<u>Key Payment and Service Information<\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;as soon as possible before contacting us.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Another type of problem <\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where there was another type of problem with your account or with our service which is not mentioned above.\nFor instance, we may have made a factual, computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal when you added money to or withdrew money from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If a purchase that you paid for with PayPal was not as described or you have not received the purchase, the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy, not this section, may apply.&nbsp.\nPlease see the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy&nbsp;for how to deal with these particular problems.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Step 2: Tell us about the problem <p>\n<strong>\n<u>Contact us&nbsp;as soon as possible<\/u>\n<\/strong> to tell us about the problem (including the type of problem you are contacting us about so that we can help you as quickly as we can).<\/p>\n<p>You must give us all the information we reasonably request as to the circumstances of the problem and take all reasonable steps we request to assist us in our investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If you tell us about your problem orally, we may require that you report your problem in writing within 10&nbsp;<strong>Business Days<\/strong> after that.<\/p>\n<p>We may provide third parties with information we consider relevant in such circumstances in accordance with our <strong>\n<u>Privacy Policy<\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;(alternatively known as our Privacy Statement).<\/p> How we will help...\n<p>Subject to the rest of this user agreement, we aim to investigate the problem and work with you to resolve it within 60 days.\nIn addition, if your problem is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an unexpected billing agreement payment, <\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;within 10 Business Days after telling us about it we will either: <ul>\n<li>reimburse you for the payment amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>explain why we cannot reimburse you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an incorrect payment to another Paypal account, <\/u>\n<\/strong>we will:<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>make immediate efforts to trace the payment and notify you of the outcome without charge to you;<\/li>\n<li>compensate you as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) by putting your account in the state it would have been in had the incorrect payment been sent as actually specified by the sender.\nThis means: <ul>\n<li>If the incorrect payment resulted in you having less money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we will credit your account for the difference.<\/li>\n<li>If the incorrect payment resulted in you having more money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we may debit the extra funds from your&nbsp;account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>reimburse you in your account for your losses or damages directly and reasonably foreseeably caused by the incorrect payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an unauthorised payment to another PayPal account, <\/u>\n<\/strong>as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) we will put your account back to where it would have been had the payment never happened.&nbsp.\nThis can include a <u>reimbursement<\/u> of your payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul> When we can’t compensate you...\n<p>You are not entitled to any financial compensation from us as outlined above and you will owe to us (and we may reverse from your account) any compensation you have already received from us if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You do not give us all the information we reasonably requested as to the circumstances of the problem (including, if you tell us about your problem orally, you fail to comply with our request that you tell us about your problem in writing within 10&nbsp;<strong>Business Days<\/strong>);<\/li>\n<li>You do not take all reasonable steps that we request to assist us in our investigation;<\/li>\n<li>We can show that you acted fraudulently;<\/li>\n<li>We can show that circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood or loss of internet connection) caused the problem, despite our reasonable precautions;<\/li>\n<li>We have reason to believe otherwise that there is no problem which entitles you to compensation.\nor<\/li>\n<li>In respect of the following specific problems:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Unexpected billing agreement payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Incorrect payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Unauthorised payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 8 weeks after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>You agreed for us to make your payment and the details were made available to you by us or the merchant at least 4 weeks before the payment was made.<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that you gave us the wrong payment details.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that the payment was sent as the payer specified when the payer asked us to make it.\nor<\/p>\n<p>Through no fault of ours, you did not have enough PayPal balance to complete the payment.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/p>\n<p>A delay which you claimed caused the incorrect payment actually resulted from PayPal applying&nbsp;a <strong>hold, limitation or reserve <\/strong>\n<strong>under this user agreement<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that the payment was made because you did not keep your account safe either intentionally or with gross negligence (for instance, you very carelessly chose to share your PayPal ID and/or password/PIN with someone else).\nor<\/p>\n<p>There was <strong>another security /fraud problem<\/strong> and you didn’t tell us about it.\nWe will not pay you compensation for any unauthorised payments made from your account before you told us about that problem.\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes we might spot the problem first.&nbsp.\nIf we need to notify you about the problem, we will ordinarily do so through the Secure Messaging Centre, which you need to log into your account to access.\nIf you should take action urgently, we may also use other means such as email to request action.<\/p>\n<p>If a payment was made from us to your funding source by way of mistake, we may correct the mistake by debiting or crediting (as the case may be) your appropriate funding source(s).<\/p> Complaints Reporting disputes between you and PayPal regarding our services<p>Contact us&nbsp;to report disputes between you and PayPal regarding our services.<\/p>\n<p>If a dispute

services, applications, messaging, and tools.<\/p>\n<p>The specific names and types of the cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies we use may change from time to time.\nIn order to help

(typically made up of letters and numbers) placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message.\nCookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or

privacy statement explains how and why PayPal collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services.\nReading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.<\/p>\n<p>“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.<\/p>\n<p>“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.<\/p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location.\nWhen you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law.\nWe may connect this information with your account, if you have one or if you create an account at a later date.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the kinds of personal data that we may collect when you create an account or use our services:<\/p>\n<p>1.\nInformation that identifies you, for

us<\/u> if you believe that we’ve mistakenly collected personal data from someone not allowed to use our services.\nWe’ll delete it immediately, unless we’re legally required to keep it.<\/p>\n<strong>How we use tracking technologies like cookies<\/strong>\n<p>We or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever

ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.<\/p>\n<p>You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services.\nBut, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.<\/p>\n<p>Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties.\nBecause many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to know more about how we use cookies,

privacy statement explains how and why PayPal collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services.\nReading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.<\/p>\n<p>“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.<\/p>\n<p>“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.<\/p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location.\nWhen you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law.\nWe may connect this information with your account, if you have one or if you create an account at a later date.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the kinds of personal data that we may collect when you create an account or use our services:<\/p>\n<p>1.\nInformation that identifies you, for

and choices.<\/p>\n<p>“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.<\/p>\n<p>“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.<\/p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a “device”) that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools.<\/p>\n<p>The specific names and types of the cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies we use may change from time to time.\nIn order to help you better understand this Policy and our use of such technologies we have provided the following limited terminology and definitions:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies<\/strong>&nbsp;– Small text files (typically made up of letters and numbers) placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message.\nCookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or browser.\nThere are several types of cookies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your actions during that particular browser

information to target advertising to you on or off our sites.<\/p>\n<p>We may use the terms “cookies” or “similar technologies” interchangeably in our policies to refer to all technologies that we may

store relevant information in your browser or device and later read that information in order to identify your device to our servers or internal systems.\nWhere applicable, we protect our cookies and other similar technologies to help ensure that only we and/or our authorized service providers can interpret them by assigning them a unique identifier that is designed for interpretation only by

privacy statement explains how and why PayPal collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services.\nReading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.<\/p>\n<p>“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.<\/p>\n<p>“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.<\/p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location.\nWhen you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law.\nWe may connect this information with your account, if you have one or if you create an account at a later date.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the kinds of personal data that we may collect when you create an account or use our services:<\/p>\n<p>1.\nInformation that identifies you, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First and last name<\/li>\n<li>Address<\/li>\n<li>Phone number<\/li>\n<li>Email<\/li>\n<li>IP address<\/li>\n<li>Information collected from cookies or other tracking

geolocation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>7.\nAudio, electronic, visual, biometric, or similar information, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call recordings when you talk to customer service<\/li>\n<li>Voice identification, when you consent to this biometric method of authentication<\/li>\n<li>Photo IDs and profile pictures you provide<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>8.\nProfessional or employment information, for

market our services<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from people who are not allowed to use our sites and services, such as children under the age of 13.\n<u>Contact us<\/u> if you believe that we’ve mistakenly collected personal data from someone not allowed to use our services.\nWe’ll delete it immediately, unless we’re legally required to keep it.<\/p>\n<strong>How we use tracking technologies like cookies<\/strong>\n<p>We or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever you use our services, visit our sites, or visit websites that offer our services.\nThe information collected with these technologies helps us personalize your experience, measure the effect of our ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.<\/p>\n<p>You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services.\nBut, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.<\/p>\n<p>Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties.\nBecause many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to know more about how we use cookies, read our <u>Cookie Statement<\/u>.\nTo learn how to opt-out of this kind of tracking technology, visit <u>About Ads<\/u>.<\/p> Why we collect personal data <p>We collect personal data for many

use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that

have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log

delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we

federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.<\/p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

and choices.<\/p>\n<p>“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.<\/p>\n<p>“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.<\/p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

privacy statement explains how and why PayPal collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services.\nReading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.<\/p>\n<p>“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.<\/p>\n<p>“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.<\/p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location.\nWhen you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law.\nWe may connect this information with your account, if you have one or if you create an account at a later date.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the kinds of personal data that we may collect when you create an account or use our services:<\/p>\n<p>1.\nInformation that identifies you, for

us<\/u> if you believe that we’ve mistakenly collected personal data from someone not allowed to use our services.\nWe’ll delete it immediately, unless we’re legally required to keep it.<\/p>\n<strong>How we use tracking technologies like cookies<\/strong>\n<p>We or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever you use our services, visit our sites, or visit websites that offer our services.\nThe information collected with these technologies helps us personalize your experience, measure the effect of our ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.<\/p>\n<p>You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services.\nBut, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.<\/p>\n<p>Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties.\nBecause many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to know more about how we use cookies, read our <u>Cookie Statement<\/u>.\nTo learn how to opt-out of this kind of tracking technology, visit <u>About Ads<\/u>.<\/p> Why we collect personal data <p>We collect personal data for many

this can help us enhance the security of our sites and services, and customize our services by using the right language and personalizing content such as ads and search results.<\/li>\n<li>Make it

have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your

the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices,

function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’

manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your

the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices,

function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that

data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’

have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we

federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that

rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that

rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

and choices.<\/p>\n<p>“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.<\/p>\n<p>“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.<\/p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

privacy statement explains how and why PayPal collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services.\nReading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.<\/p>\n<p>“Personal data” in this statement means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.<\/p>\n<p>“PayPal” in this statement means PayPal, Inc.\nThis privacy statement only applies to the PayPal and Xoom services offered by PayPal.\nTo learn about our privacy practices for our other products or services, like Venmo or Braintree, visit the website and review the privacy statement for that product or service.<\/p> Your privacy rights and choices <p>When it comes to how your personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared, you have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we’ll still collect personal data, which may include your payment information, device information, and location.\nWhen you use our services without creating or logging into an account, we will use this information to process transactions, prevent fraud and comply with the law.\nWe may connect this information with your account, if you have one or if you create an account at a later date.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the kinds of personal data that we may collect when you create an account or use our services:<\/p>\n<p>1.\nInformation that identifies you, for

ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.<\/p>\n<p>You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services.\nBut, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.<\/p>\n<p>Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by

have rights and choices.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your rights<\/strong>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we have collected about you.\nIf you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us.\nWe will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you request to see or delete your personal data, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request.\nIf we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal data, you have choices:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log in to your account and delete information you previously added.\nFor example, you can delete your profile picture and non-primary addresses in your settings<\/li>\n<li>Call us and request that we delete specific information<\/li>\n<li>Close your account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement or other contract you have with us<\/li>\n<li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity<\/li>\n<li>Protect your (or another person’s) legal rights, including the right to free speech<\/li>\n<li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services<\/li>\n<li>Comply with laws<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data.\nFor example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nConsumers may read our <u>Consumer Privacy Notice<\/u> for more information about their rights under US federal law.<\/p>\n<strong>Understanding your choices<\/strong>\n<p>You can control how personal data is collected or shared, as well as how we communicate with you.\nHere are some of the ways you can customize your choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we collect personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You may choose to limit the personal data you provide when our apps or services request it.\nTo help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that personal data helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you.\nAlso, some personal data is required for our services to function at all.<\/p>\n<p>For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to.\nIf you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that is required for an account to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how connected accounts collect and use personal data<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you connect your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your personal data is collected, used, and shared by them.\nRead the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you.<\/p>\n<p>You can control which third-party services you connect to your account and what personal data they can collect about you.\nFor example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choose how we communicate with you<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your personal data when you register for or use our services, such as when you create an account, make a payment, or make a purchase on a merchant’s website.<\/p>\n<p>If you use our services without

it.<\/p>\n<strong>How we use tracking technologies like cookies<\/strong>\n<p>We or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever

ads, prevent fraud and enhance the security of our sites and service.<\/p>\n<p>You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services.\nBut, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.<\/p>\n<p>Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties.\nBecause many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to know more about how we use cookies,

use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts.\nAnother example is creating an account with us.\nIf you choose not to provide information that

differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered.\nSome messages are considered optional and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us.\nWe use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences.<\/p>\n<p>You can click the unsubscribe link in a marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.\nYou can also change your account’s notification settings or the notification preferences on your device.<\/p>\n<p>You won’t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account’s status that require your attention.\nYou may be able to decide how we send those messages, such as by email, text message, or a notification on your mobile device.<\/p> The personal data we collect <p>We may collect your

internet.\nOur services allow you to send payments to anyone with a PayPal account, and, where available, to receive payments.\nOur service availability varies by country/region.\nYou can see what services are available in your country/region by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>The PayPal services are offered by PayPal Pte.\nLtd.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consumer Advisory — PayPal Pte.\nLtd., the holder of the PayPal stored value facility, does not require the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\nConsumers (users) are advised to read the terms and conditions carefully.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement is not a solicitation of the PayPal services and PayPal is not targeting any country/region or market through this user agreement.<\/p> Opening an Account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.<\/p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive payments.<\/li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.<\/li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods.<\/li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods from others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>In order to open and maintain a PayPal account, you must list your correct country/region of residence and provide us with correct and updated account information, including but not limited to personal information, financial information, or other information related to you or your business.<\/p>\n<p>You must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p> Personal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send payments to family and friends, a personal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal account you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy goods and services.<\/li>\n<li>Send and request payments from friends and family.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>You can also use a personal account to receive payments for the sale of goods and services, but if you plan to use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should consider a business account.\nYou can convert your PayPal account from a personal account to a business account should circumstances change.<\/p> Business accounts <p>We recommend business accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business account, you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening, when you request certain new products and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business account.<\/strong>\n<\/p> Commercial Entity Agreement <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.<\/p> Third Party permissions <p>You must be the beneficial owner of your PayPal account, and conduct business only on behalf of yourself.<\/p>\n<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.\nIn some cases, you can do this when logged into your PayPal account – in other cases, you can do this directly with the third party.\nYou acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your PayPal account to this third party.<\/p>\n<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;<\/li>\n<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your PayPal account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.\nYou are liable to us for the actions that you authorize the third parties to carry out.\nYou will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost or penalty, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nYou must withdraw or transfer any PayPal balance from your PayPal account before closing it.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.\n<\/p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card or a bank account to your PayPal account as a payment method.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (i.e.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.<\/p> Holding a PayPal Balance <p>Any PayPal balance you hold represents an unsecured claim against PayPal.\nPayPal combines your balance with the balances of other users and invests those funds in liquid investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held separate from PayPal's corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.\nYou will not receive interest or other earnings on the amounts in your balance.\nYou agree PayPal shall own the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nYou agree to assign any rights to any interest derived from your funds to PayPal.<\/p> Adding or Withdrawing Funds Adding funds to your balance <p>You may use the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to fund transactions you make using your PayPal account.\nYou don't need a PayPal balance to buy something or send payments.\nYou can add funds your PayPal account from the bank account that's linked to your PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer to your PayPal account.\nThe amount transferred will be held as a balance in your PayPal account.\nCredit cards cannot be used to add funds to your PayPal balance.<\/p> Withdrawing funds from your balance <p>If you have a PayPal balance, log into your PayPal account to see which of these withdrawal options are available in your country/region:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it to a bank account linked to your PayPal account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>transferring it to your debit or credit card, where available.\nor<\/li>\n<li>requesting a physical cheque through the mail, where available.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on the country/region in which your account is registered, you may be able to withdraw your funds through a third party service provider.\nPlease see terms of such third party for information regarding currency conversions.<\/p>\n<p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or the negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit card or debit card information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may charge a fee to make a transfer to your bank account.\nIf your debit card is eligible to receive withdrawals from your PayPal account, you will be provided the option to use it when you transfer funds out of your PayPal balance, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for personal accounts) page and the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business accounts) page.\nThe applicable fees will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, we will send physical cheques through the mail only to confirmed addresses, unless we have verified your PayPal account.\nWe will not send cheques to post office boxes.\nIf you would like us to send a cheque to an address that does not meet these criteria, you must contact customer service and provide the documentation that we request to verify your association with the address.\nIf you fail to cash a cheque within 180 Days of the date of issuance, we will return the funds to your balance (minus a fee).<\/p> Managing Your Balance in Multiple Currencies Holding multiple currencies <p>Your PayPal balance may be held in any of the currencies supported by PayPal, and you may hold a balance in more than one of these currencies at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your PayPal account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the balance into another currency.\nIf you convert the balance in your account, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of your balance that you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.<\/li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the balance in the opening currency of your account or such other currency that PayPal supports for withdrawal in your registered country/region.\nIn order to withdraw the balance in your account which is held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate, including our currency conversion fee, will be used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To receive funds in a currency that your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your PayPal account in that currency or convert the balance into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in your PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.<\/p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).<\/p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe currency conversion fee applicable can be found on our fees page under the heading Currency conversion fees.<\/p>Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and involves a currency conversion by PayPal, you consent to and authorize us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis currency preference selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and the fees they may charge.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use your existing PayPal balance or your linked bank account is the payment method.<\/p> Account Statements Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSending payments and buying Sending payments to or Receiving payments from a Friend or Family Member Sending payments <p>In some countries/regions, you can send funds to a friend or family member from your PayPal account using the send payments feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called personal payments or peer-to-peer/P2P payments).\n<\/p>\n<p>Visit our Available Services by Country/Region of Residence list to see which services are available in your country/region of residence or log into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>You can send funds to a friend or family member even if they don't have a PayPal account at the time you send them funds, using their email address or mobile number, in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending funds does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't claim it, it will be refunded to you.\nReceiving funds from a friend or family member is described under <strong>Receiving Funds<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of funds you can send, including funds you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging in to your PayPal account.\nWe may increase your sending limits if you complete the same steps to verify your information as is required for the removal of withdrawal limits.<\/p>\n<p>When you send funds to a friend or family member, one of three things may happen: they may accept, decline or fail to claim the funds.\nIf they either decline to accept the funds or don't claim them within 30 days of the date they are sent, the funds (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal Credit as the payment method, or<\/li>\n<li>Your PayPal balance, if you used your PayPal balance as the payment method or a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Receiving payments <p>If a friend or family member sends funds to you, the funds will appear in your PayPal balance.\nTo receive funds in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the funds into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p> Fees for Sending payments to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending funds can be found in our Sending funds table and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send funds to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert your PayPal balance from one currency to another, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you send funds to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party's product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.<\/p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal in any currency that the seller accepts, and that PayPal supports, using the funds in your PayPal balance, or using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer's website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Sending a payment to a seller for good or services.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller's physical store.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.<\/p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third-party websites or applications, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>American Express may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as branded airlines and certain travel merchants;<\/li>\n<li>Some credit cards may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as those in the gambling industry.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Credit cards cannot be used to send personal payments or to top up your PayPal balance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied as described in the How we convert currency section and will be determined at the time the payment is processed.<\/p>\nFees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you don't pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>Your credit card or debit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for transactions.<\/p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don't clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\nAutomatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows the seller to take funds from your PayPal account with your authorization on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>You may cancel an automatic payment up to 3 Business Days before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the PayPal Help Centre.\nOnce an automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller funds for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for and you may be required to pay the seller through alternative means.<\/p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs a currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal's currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal balance.\nIf you used a bank account as the payment method for the transaction, we will refund the payment to your bank account, or to your PayPal balance if we cannot refund it to your bank account.\nFor purchases you make in a seller's store location that you paid for using your PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will be refunded to your PayPal balance.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal performed a currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>within 1 day of the date of the original payment, the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) used at the time of the original payment will apply.<\/li>\n<li>beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) on the date of the refund will apply.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\nThis means that you may not receive the full amount of your original payment due to the fees above and fluctuations in currency conversion rates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Payments will be refunded in the currency you paid, or if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.<\/p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction Selecting a preferred payment method <p>In certain countries, you can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.<\/p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions and automatic payments with a seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the \"Manage\" link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.<\/p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.<\/p> Sending payments to friends and family <p>When you send payments to friends and family using your PayPal balance (if available) or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the \"Change\" link on the Send Payments page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send the payment.<\/p>\nAutomatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way to pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can select a payment method for future purchases with a particular seller either at the time of creating the agreement or in your account settings.\nFor example, you can instruct your monthly movie subscription service to always charge your credit card for the monthly cost.<\/p>\n<p>If your chosen payment method is unavailable (e.g.\ncredit card expired), a particular agreement with a seller does not provide for the ability to specify a payment method, or if you have not designated a payment method for future transactions with a seller, the payment method used will be in the following order, as applicable: 1.\nbalance.\n2.\nbank account (instant transfer).\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\ndebit card.\n6.\ncredit card.\nand 7.\neCheque.<\/p>\n<p>You can cancel any agreement in your account settings.<\/p>\nBank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.<\/p> eCheque <p>eCheque is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside of your country/region.<\/p>\n<p>If eCheque is your preferred payment method, it will be used to fund your PayPal payment, even if you have a balance.<\/p> PayPal’s Buyer Protection Program PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal's Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Buyer Protection program.\nPayPal's original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal's Buyer Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal's Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an \"Item Not Received\" claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a \"Significantly Not as Described\" claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Buyer Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions.<\/p>\nItem Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>will not<\/em> qualify for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program for an Item Not Received claim if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller's store location, or<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to your address, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p> Significantly Not As Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller's description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as \"new\" but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\nit is counterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn't receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was materially damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially similar to the seller's description of it.<\/li>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as \"used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIneligible items and transactions under PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in all or part of a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller's store location.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government

requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.\n<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Centre within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, and follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nOur online dispute resolution process <p>If you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Centre to pursue a claim under our Buyer Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 1:<\/strong>\n<strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 2:<\/strong>\n<strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the Resolution Centre.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 3:<\/strong>\n<strong>Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 4:<\/strong>\n<strong>Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you're filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.<\/p>\nProof of delivery means: <p>For transactions that total less than $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/ or postal code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.<\/p>\n<p>For transactions that total $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery (except for buyers having a PayPal account registered: in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Iceland, Israel, or Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Signature<\/strong>\n<strong>confirmation currency

USD<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 5: PayPal will make a final decision<\/strong> (including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.<\/p>\n<p>In the event that PayPal makes a final decision in favour of the buyer or seller, each party must comply with PayPal's decision.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal finds in favour of a buyer, PayPal will reimburse the buyer for the full purchase price of the item and original shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>In a seller loses a claim, the seller will not receive a refund on the PayPal fees associated with the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If a seller loses a Significantly Not as Described claim due to the item sold being counterfeit, the seller will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you will not receive the item back.<\/p>\nDispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a credit card or debit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don't qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Buyer Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can't do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we'll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won't affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).\nBefore contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller's return policy.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSelling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services Receiving personal payments <p>The ability to receive payments varies by country/region.\nYou can determine whether you have the ability to receive payments by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.<\/li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you a personal payment for a purchase.\nIf you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account's ability to accept payments from friends or family members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Terms.<\/p>\nNo surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.<\/p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, wherever PayPal’s branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal’s services or marks.<\/p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal service as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over any PayPal service.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising and other customer communications), you agree to display the PayPal services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.<\/p>\nTaxes, information reporting <p>Some of our fees may be subject to applicable taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including, for example, value-added tax, sales tax, income tax, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, \"taxes\") and, unless expressly noted, our fees are exclusive of applicable taxes.\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.<\/p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy, where required by law.<\/p>\nPayment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you by email and/or through your PayPal account.<\/p> In-store payments <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace's or the third party application's buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a \"card not present\" transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.<\/p>\nAccepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer's account through preauthorized payments either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer, \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers:<\/p>\n<p>You must:<\/p>\n<p>You must not:<\/p>\n<p>Get each buyer's prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.<\/p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer's written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancellation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.<\/p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.<\/p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer's option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.<\/p> Automatic Transfer Countries <p>If you are a resident of an Automatic Transfer Country, then you have the ability to receive payments, but you must withdraw the full amount of your payment through an available withdrawal method.\nIf you do not do so, the amounts will be automatically withdrawn from your PayPal account to your withdrawal method on a regular basis.\nFor additional terms regarding Automatic Transfer, please click here.<\/p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments Standard transactions fees <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on the buyer's country/region.\nThe fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Commercial Payments Fees table.\nPlease note that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 14 days' advance notice of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.<\/li>\n<li>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.<\/li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Merchant rate <p>To qualify for our merchant rate, you must submit a one-time application, have a qualifying monthly sales volume, and have a business account in good standing.\nTo view Merchant rate criteria click here.<\/p>\nMicropayments Fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10 USD.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative PayPal balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the <strong>Micropayment Fees table<\/strong> will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of the Commercial Payments Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.<\/p>\n<p>By applying for Micropayments for Digital Goods, you agree that for digital goods transactions you receive up to the amounts in the <strong>table<\/strong>, then if a buyer opens a Dispute, PayPal may reverse the transaction, and remove the funds from your account without requiring the buyer to escalate the dispute to a claim.<\/p>\nPayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal's Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal business account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand<\/li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.\n<\/p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay services, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.<\/p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee described below).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account in the same currency as the original transaction.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.\n(This will not apply to residents of Mainland China who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.)<\/p>\n<p>The buyer's account will be credited with the full payment amount, or a portion of the payment amount in the event of a partial refund, we'll retain the fixed fee portion of the fees you paid, and the amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.<\/p>\nPayments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Buyer Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.<\/li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven't opted out).<\/li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer's bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.<\/li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized.<\/li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement, the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy or any other agreement between you and PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of the payment sent to you may be calculated in that currency, using PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover your liability for the payment amount plus the fees, then this will result in a negative PayPal balance.\nAny negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your PayPal balance to eliminate it.\nIf you do not do so, PayPal may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>recover any amounts due to PayPal by debiting your balance;<\/li>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you;<\/li>\n<li>take any and all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nDispute fees<p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout<strong>.\n<\/strong>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee <\/strong>rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee <\/strong>rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> amount will be determined when the dispute is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your disputes ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions<\/strong>\n<strong>, <\/strong>and all chargebacks from the buyer’s card issuer or reversals from the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>If your Disputes Ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.<\/p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee <\/strong>for disputes that are<em>:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal’s Seller Protection<\/strong> program.<\/li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a <strong>Standard Dispute fee.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>Decided in your favour by PayPal or your issuer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees <\/strong>may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.<\/p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.<\/p>\n<p>This Dispute fees section does not apply to residents of Malaysia who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\nChargeback fees<p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, PayPal will charge you a chargeback fee for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee will apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.<\/p>\n<p>The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is the amount specified on the Chargeback Fees table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the Chargeback fee table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.<\/p>\n<p>If a buyer files a chargeback, the card issuer, not PayPal, will determine who wins the chargeback.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee Table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the Chargeback Fee Table the fee assessed in your primary holding currency.<\/p>\nImpact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal's Buyer Protection program and if you sell goods and services to and receive payments from buyers with PayPal accounts in countries/regions other than your own, you should also be familiar with the PayPal Buyer Protection available to buyers in each of those countries/regions.\nBuyers' rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find this information for PayPal's programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer's location at the top of the page and referring to the applicable user agreement for that geography.<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal's Buyer Protection program in any country/region:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be required to reimburse PayPal for your liability.<\/li>\n<li>Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back), and the PayPal fees that you were charged for the transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay's decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover such claim.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>We offer Seller Protection based on the Seller Protection program for the country/region you selected when you opened your account.\nThe Seller Protection program for the following countries/regions are part of this user agreement.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Central Europe, Middle East and Africa<\/strong> (excluding Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other countries covered by a country/region-specific User Agreement)<\/li>\n<\/ul> What's eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under <strong>Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks<\/strong>, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal's Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal's Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize or benefit from funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an \"<strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>\" and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They did not receive the item from you (referred to as an \"<strong>Item Not Received<\/strong>\" claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer's bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal's Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the <strong>Impact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers<\/strong>.<\/p>\nBasic requirements<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You provide us with valid proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a tangible item except for items subject to the Intangible Goods Additional Requirements.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Centre.\nIf you do not respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>You must accept payment from a PayPal account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).<\/li>\n<li>The payment must be marked “eligible” or “partially eligible” in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims, for PayPal's Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nItem Not Received additional requirement<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection program for a buyer's Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked \"eligible\" or \"partially eligible\" for PayPal's Seller Protection on the transaction details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements:<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third-party or if you have a native app integration.<\/li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>Paid standard transaction fees on the sale.<\/li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of shipment or delivery for Intangible Goods.<\/li>\n<li>Provide signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table.\nIf the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nEstablishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods:<\/p>\n<p>Proof of shipment<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery<\/p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the transaction details page<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of delivery and \"delivered\" status of the item or service.<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<li>Signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes exceeds) the fixed amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table .\nSignature confirmation is online documentation, viewable at the shipping company's website, indicating that the item was signed for (save for Sellers having a PayPal Account registered in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT<\/strong>: Your choice of carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.\nPlease ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide ‘delivered' status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for intangible goods:<\/p>\n<p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.\nCompelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Received or accessed by the

<p>If we believe that you've engaged in any of these activities, we may take a number of actions to protect PayPal, its customers and others at any time in our sole discretion.\nThe actions we may take include, but are not limited to, the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terminate this user agreement, limit your PayPal account, and/or close or suspend your PayPal account, immediately and without penalty to us;<\/li>\n<li>Refuse to provide the PayPal services to you now and in the future;<\/li>\n<li>Limit your access to our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, your PayPal account or any of the PayPal services, including limiting your ability to pay or send payments with any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account, restricting your ability to send payments or make withdrawals;<\/li>\n<li>Hold your PayPal balance if reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability to PayPal or a third party, or if you have violated our Acceptable Use Policy;<\/li>\n<li>Suspend your eligibility for PayPal's Buyer Protection program and/or PayPal's Seller Protection program;<\/li>\n<li>Contact buyers who have purchased goods or services from you using PayPal, your bank or credit card issuer, other impacted third parties or law enforcement about your actions;<\/li>\n<li>Update inaccurate information you provided us;<\/li>\n<li>Take legal action against you;<\/li>\n<li>Hold, apply or transfer the funds in your PayPal account as required by judgments and orders which affect you or your PayPal account, including judgments and orders issued by courts in Singapore or elsewhere and directed to PayPal or its affiliates;<\/li>\n<li>If you've violated our Acceptable Use Policy, then you're also responsible for damages to PayPal caused by your violation of this policy.\nor<\/li>\n<li>If you violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal's damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.\nYou acknowledge and agree that $2,500 USD (or equivalent) per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.\nPayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing PayPal balance in any PayPal account you control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we close your PayPal account or terminate your use of the PayPal services for any reason, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and make any unrestricted funds held in your PayPal account available for withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by PayPal, any PayPal customer, or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this user agreement, and/or your use of the PayPal services.<\/p> Holds, Limitations and Reserves What are holds, limitations and reserves <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nUnless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we'll provide you with notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these actions.\nTo request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.<\/p>\n<p>In order to facilitate PayPal’s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal’s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.<\/p>\nHolds<p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the funds shall not be available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.<\/li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.<\/li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHolds based on PayPal’s risk decisions<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe'll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.\n<\/p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 30 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account unless PayPal has a reason to continue to hold the payment.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you've uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 30 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we'll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved.<\/p>\nHolds related to Marketplace transactions<p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third-party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third-party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third-party directly.<\/p>\nHolds based on disputed transactions<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we'll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we'll remove the funds from your PayPal account.<\/p>\nAccount Limitations<p>Limitations prevent you from completing certain actions with your PayPal account, such as withdrawing, sending or receiving payments.\nThese limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why we may limit your access to your PayPal account or the PayPal services, and/or limit access to your funds, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we'll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.<\/li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you've received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks selling an entirely new or high cost product, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we limit access to your PayPal account, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and the opportunity to request restoration of access if, in our sole discretion, we deem it appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>\nReserves<p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some of the transactions will be shown as \"pending\" in your PayPal balance, and you will not be able to withdraw funds in a \"pending\" status, in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors, and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, we'll notify you of our actions and the terms of the reserve.<\/p>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve<\/strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the funds you receive on day 1 are held and then released on day 91, 10% of the funds you receive on day 2 are held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve<\/strong> is a specific minimum amount that you're required to keep available in your PayPal balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we'll notify you of the new terms.\n<\/p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place as long as reasonably necessary as determined by PayPal.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nLiability for Unauthorized Transactions Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n<\/p>\nWhat is an Unauthorized Transaction<p>An \"Unauthorized Transaction\" occurs when a payment is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.<\/p>\nWhat is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction<p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nReporting an Unauthorized Transaction<p>You should contact PayPal customer service immediately if you believe:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>there has been an Unauthorized Transaction sent from your account;<\/li>\n<li>there has been unauthorized access to your account;<\/li>\n<li>your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen.\nor<\/li>\n<li>any device you have used to access your PayPal account has been lost, stolen or deactivated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You must give us all the available information relating to circumstances of any Unauthorized Transactions, and/or misappropriated or unauthorized use of your account, and take all reasonable steps requested to assist PayPal in its investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If you notify us of an Unauthorized Transaction within 60 days of the transaction and we are satisfied that it was an Unauthorized Transaction, you will be eligible for 100% protection for the Unauthorized Transaction.<\/p> Error Resolution What is an Error<p>An \"Error\" means the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a processing error made by PayPal or its suppliers in which your PayPal account is mistakenly debited or credited, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.<\/li>\n<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nWhat is not considered an Error<p>The following are NOT considered errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>If you erroneously send a payment to the wrong party, or send a payment for the wrong amount (based on a typographical error, for example).\n(Your only recourse in this instance will be to contact the party to whom you sent the payment and ask them to refund the payment.\nPayPal will not reimburse you or reverse a payment that you have made in error.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIn case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers<p>Contact us at our Resolution Centre.<\/p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name, email address and account number (if any).<\/li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.<\/li>\n<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.\nWe will complete our investigation within 10 Business Days after we receive your notification of

transferring them to your local Malaysian bank account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Governing Law.<\/strong> For Malaysian residents who register for the PayPal services with a Malaysian address, this user agreement is governed by and interpreted under the laws of Malaysia as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Malaysia.\nExcept as amended by these terms and conditions, all other provisions of the user agreement remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Amendments<\/strong>.\nWe may amend this user agreement and any of the policies and other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to users in Malaysia from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it on our website, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities, we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you with at least 21 days’ notice.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>PayPal suspension and termination rights.<\/strong> PayPal, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to suspend or terminate this user agreement, access to or use of its websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the PayPal services, at any time upon notice to you: (i) if you breach this user agreement, the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy, the Commercial Entity Agreements (as they apply to you), or any other agreement between you and PayPal, or (ii) if we determine, acting reasonably, that we should do so due to other circumstances or reasons.\nOur determination shall be final and binding except in the case of manifest error or bad faith.\nUpon termination of this user agreement, PayPal shall arrange the payment to you of any unrestricted funds held in your PayPal balance.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Chargeback fees.<\/strong> If you receive a debit or credit card-funded payment through your PayPal account and the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, PayPal will not assess you with a chargeback fee if the transaction is eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nHowever, if the transaction is ineligible for PayPal Seller Protection, PayPal will assess you with a chargeback fee (for facilitating the chargeback process) regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.<\/p>\n<p>The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is the amount specified on the Chargeback Fees table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf you do not have the correct currency available in your PayPal balance at the time of the refund or reversal, a currency conversion will be required and a currency conversion fee will apply.<\/p>\n<p>If a buyer files a chargeback, the card issuer, not PayPal, will determine who wins the chargeback.<\/p>Morocco

funds.<\/p>\n<p>* The bank partner of PayPal for the withdrawal functionality charges a fee for each withdrawal.\nUpon enablement of the receive and withdraw functionalities, PayPal will provide you with additional information.<\/p>\nThe Philippines <p>If you are using a service (\"Third Party Service\") offered by a PayPal partner bank, licensed foreign-exchange service provider, remittance

effective for all users as of November 9, 2020.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to PayPal!<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal, Inc.\ngoverning your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nIt applies to U.S.\nPayPal accounts only.\nIf you are an individual, you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your state of residence to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of, the United States or one of its territories to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nThe terms include an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration on an individual basis.\nYou also agree to comply with each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you and the following additional policies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>Electronic Communications Delivery Policy (E-Sign Disclosure and Consent)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may revise this agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you at least 21 days advance notice for personal accounts and at least 5 days advance notice for business accounts.\nBy continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement, you agree to abide and be bound by those changes.\nIf you do not agree with any changes to this user agreement, you may close your account.<\/p> Opening a PayPal Account <p>We offer two types of PayPal accounts: personal PayPal accounts and business PayPal accounts, both covered by this user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive money.<\/li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.<\/li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, or other payment options, including funds held as balance in a business PayPal account (if we have verified the required identifying information you provide to us) or funds held in a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account linked to a personal PayPal account if you choose to open a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nThe term “Cash Account” in this user agreement will be used to refer to either a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, Cash Account and other payment methods from others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nYou must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Personal PayPal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send money to family and friends, a personal PayPal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal PayPal account you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and request money from friends and family.<\/li>\n<li>Buy goods and services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also use a personal PayPal account to receive money for the sale of goods and services and hold that money in a linked Cash Account or transfer it to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not open a Cash Account, but if you plan to use your personal PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should open a business PayPal account.\nYou can also convert your personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account should circumstances change.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Business PayPal accounts <p>We recommend business PayPal accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services or accept donations, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business PayPal account, you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your business PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your business PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Business PayPal accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business PayPal account or converting a personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business PayPal account.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Commercial Entity Status <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your PayPal account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to a personal PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any funds held in your Cash Account before closing your personal PayPal account, and closing a personal PayPal account will result in PayPal automatically closing any linked Cash Account.\nIf you have a business PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any balance from your business PayPal account before closing it, and if you have not provided the required identifying information to us, or if we are unable to verify the required identifying information you provide, you must transfer any balance in your business PayPal account to a linked bank account or debit card.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your personal or business PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.<\/p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink certain payment methods such as a credit card, debit card, a U.S.\nbank account or PayPal Credit to your PayPal account.\nYou can also link a Cash Account to your personal PayPal account as a payment method and unlink the Cash Account by withdrawing all funds and closing it.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.\nTo do this, we will charge $1.95 to the card.\nAfter the card is confirmed, we will immediately refund this amount to the card.<\/p> Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds Personal PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to your personal PayPal account cannot be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nWhen you receive money to your personal PayPal account, you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transfer the money via a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your personal PayPal account for free;<\/li>\n<li>transfer the money via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your personal PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Funds (for personal PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal;<\/li>\n<li>request PayPal to send the money to you by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nIf you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your linked Cash Account if you have one or hold the funds on your behalf and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.\nWe will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you;<\/li>\n<li>open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nA Cash Account is separate account from your personal PayPal account.\nIf you open a Cash Account, we will automatically link your Cash Account to your personal PayPal account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You also cannot transfer money to your personal PayPal account to be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nYou will need to open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account, which can be used for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Except as provided below, any balance in your Cash Account and any funds sent to you which have not yet been transferred to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not have a Cash Account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<\/p>\n<p>PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.\nYou will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.\nPayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.\nPayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from PayPal’s corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a PayPal Cash Card debit card as part of a Cash Account, have enrolled in Direct Deposit, or have established Goals in PayPal, such funds will have pass-through FDIC insurance as further detailed in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Business PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to a business PayPal account can be held directly as balance in the business PayPal account.\nThe balance functionality in your business PayPal account will differ depending on whether we have been able to verify the required identifying information that you provide to us.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>The required identifying information is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For sole proprietorships: name, physical address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number.\nor<\/li>\n<li>For other types of business legal entities: business name, business address, taxpayer identification number, and proof of business existence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we have not verified the required identifying information, a balance in your business PayPal account can only be held in your business PayPal account and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card or you can request PayPal to send you the money by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nYour balance may also be used to fund payments or money owed to PayPal, such as payments on your PayPal Working Capital account or monies owed for refunds or chargebacks.<\/p>\n<p>If we have verified the required identifying information, a balance can be held in your business PayPal account, transferred to a linked bank account or debit card, used to make purchases or send money to others.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a business PayPal account and we have verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you may transfer money to the balance of your business PayPal account from any bank account linked to your business PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer from your bank account.\nIf we have not verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you cannot add funds to your balance in a business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>You can withdraw balance from your business PayPal account by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it via a standard transfer to a bank account linked to your business PayPal account for free,<\/li>\n<li>transferring it via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your business PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal,<\/li>\n<li>withdrawing it from an ATM (automated teller machine) if you have a PayPal-branded debit card (fees may apply), or<\/li>\n<li>Requesting a check from us (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nIf you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your balance in your business PayPal account and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.\nWe will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Any balance you hold in your business account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<\/p>\n<p>PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.\nYou will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.\nPayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.\nPayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nHowever, the claim against PayPal represented by your PayPal funds is not secured by these investments and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from PayPal’s corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Restrictions on transfers or withdrawals from PayPal accounts <p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting two out of three of the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit or debit card information.<\/li>\n<li>Providing your social security number.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies Holding currency other than U.S.\ndollars <p>Your balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, if you have one, may be held in currencies other than U.S.\ndollars.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the funds to balance in another currency.\nIf you convert funds in your account, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.<\/li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the funds in U.S.\ndollars.\nIn order to withdraw funds in your account held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to U.S.\ndollars, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal’s currency conversion rate, including our currency conversion spread, will be used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To receive money in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, in that currency or convert the money into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the money into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the money is converted, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal Cash Account or business PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion spread applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).<\/p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe applicable currency conversion spread can be found on our Fees page under the heading Currency conversion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines a currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorize PayPal to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nCurrency preference selections may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, and may be made available individually for each card and for each automatic payment agreement.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where your Cash Account balance, business PayPal account balance or linked bank account is the payment method.<\/p> Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, you will receive two statements: one showing all transactions in your personal PayPal account and an additional statement showing only transactions involving your Cash Account.<\/p> Sending Money and Buying Sending Money to a Friend or Family Member Sending money <p>You can send money to a friend or family member using the send money feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called “personal payments” or “peer-to-peer/P2P payments”).\nYou can send money to a friend or family member even if they don’t have a PayPal account at the time you send them money, using their email address or mobile number in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don’t claim it, it will be refunded to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can send, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>When you send money to a friend or family member who has a PayPal account, one of two things may happen: they may accept or decline the money.\nIf they decline to accept the money, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card, PayPal Credit, a Cash Account, or balance in a business PayPal account as the payment method, or<\/li>\n<li>The balance in your business PayPal account or the balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account if you used a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>If you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending money can be found on our Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family page and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send money to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert money in your Cash Account balance or in your business PayPal account balance from one currency to another before sending money, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nIf you use your credit card as the payment method when sending money, you may also be charged a cash-advance fee by your card issuer.<\/p>\n<p>If you send money to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party’s product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the send money feature in your PayPal account to pay for goods or services.\nYou will not be charged any transaction fee for sending money to purchase goods or services as long as you choose the “send money to pay for goods and services” feature in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, the seller will pay a fee.\nYou must not use the “send money to a friend or family member” feature in your PayPal account when you are paying for goods or services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal <p>&nbsp;<\/p> How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, in any currency that the seller accepts and that PayPal supports using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer’s website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Sending money to a seller for goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller’s physical store using an electronic terminal, subject to certain limitations.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller’s physical store using your own mobile device and a QR code, subject to certain limitations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don’t open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.<\/p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third party websites or applications.<\/p>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a currency conversion spread) will be used, and may be the rate at the time the payment is processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Fees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal you don’t pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nYour debit or credit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for non-U.S.\ntransactions.<\/p>\n<p>In addition you may be required to pay a fee to PayPal if you are making a purchase using PayPal Business Payments and the seller discloses to you that you, as the buyer, must pay the fee.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don’t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Automatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows you to pay the seller on a one-time, recurring or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a “billing agreement,” \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>If you have a personal PayPal account, you may cancel a recurring automatic payment up to 3 <strong>Business Days<\/strong> before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the <strong>PayPal Help Center<\/strong>, or by calling PayPal at (888) 221-1161.<\/p>\n<p>Once your automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller money for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for.<\/p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal’s <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a debit card, credit card, PayPal Credit, or a balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a personal PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your linked Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a business PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your balance in your business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller’s store location that you paid for using your personal PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller’s store location that you paid for using your business PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your balance in your business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you used Pay with Rewards to fund your transaction, your refund will be processed back as a dollar amount: depending on your card agreement with your issuer, your issuer may or may not credit your purchase back to your reward balance.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal performed currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) used at the time of the original payment will apply.<\/li>\n<li>Beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) on the date of the refund will apply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Money will be refunded in the currency you paid.\nor if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.\nor we are unable to refund in your primary holding currency, then in U.S.\ndollars.<\/p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction <p>&nbsp;<\/p> Selecting a preferred payment method <p>You can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences on <strong>www.paypal.com<\/strong> or in the PayPal app.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.<\/p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions, and each of your automatic payment agreements, as described below.<\/p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.<\/p>\n<p>If no preferred payment method, it’s still your choice.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the “Manage” link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for in-store or automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Sending money to friends and family <p>When you send money to friends and family within the U.S.\nusing balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the balance in your business PayPal account, or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the “Change” link on the Send Money page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send money.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Automatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way you pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\nTo help minimize disruptions in your automatic payments, we may update your Payment Method information.\nsee Link or Unlink a Payment Method.<\/p>\n<p>When you first set up an automatic payment agreement, you may have the option to set up a preferred payment method for such agreement.\nYou can review, set, or change a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement in your account settings on paypal.com.<\/p>\n<p>Your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement will be used for transactions with that seller.\nIf you have available balance in a linked Cash or cash Plus account, that balance may be used before your preferred payment method.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not set a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement, or if your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement is unavailable (for example, because it is expired or has insufficient funds) the payment method used will be in the following order, if applicable: 1.\nCash Account (if one is linked to your personal PayPal account) or balance in your business PayPal account (if we’ve been able to verify the <strong>required identifying information<\/strong> you provide to us).\n2.\nBank account.\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\nDebit card.\n6.\nCredit card.\nand 7.\nE-check.\nThis is also the order of payment methods that will be used if a previously selected payment method to be used in a seller agreement is unavailable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Bank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.<\/p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to pay for an item and you select your bank account as the funding method for the transaction, remember that your PayPal account is issued to you by PayPal and not your bank.\nThe terms, benefits, and protections associated with your PayPal account may vary from those that apply to your bank account.\nIf you use your PayPal account to make a purchase that exceeds the balance in your linked bank account, you could incur overdraft fees, even if you chose not to allow overdrafts with your bank.\nSimilarly, the liability limits applicable to your PayPal account may differ from those applicable to your bank account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> E-check <p>E-check is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside the United States.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Pay with Rewards <p>PayPal may allow you to redeem rewards associated with your eligible card(s) when making a purchase with your PayPal account through PayPal’s Pay with Rewards program.\nPayPal may share with and receive information from your issuer about your issuer accounts to complete the redemption of your rewards when using PayPal’s Pay with Rewards program.\nThe exchange of this information is necessary to complete the purchase when you select the Pay with Rewards redemption option.<\/p> All Pay with Rewards redemptions are subject to the terms of your card agreement with your card issuer.\nPay with Rewards is only available for eligible purchases with certain merchants, and PayPal or your issuer may limit, suspend, or terminate your ability to redeem rewards at any time in accordance with this user agreement and your card agreement.\nYour issuer determines the value of rewards redeemed through PayPal and available redemption methods (e.g., to pay for your purchase or for a statement credit).\nThere may be a delay between checkout and processing of your payment.\nOnly rewards available upon processing of your payment will be used.\nBecause your reward balance and/or transaction balance may change, whenever you request to redeem rewards for a purchase you also authorize PayPal to charge up to the full payment amount to your associated card if that happens.\nFor more information on redeeming rewards and how it works, please see About Payment Methods.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Debit card processing <p>PayPal will process your debit or prepaid card funded transactions through either the ATM debit network or the Visa, MasterCard or Discover network.\nIf we process your debit or prepaid card through an ATM debit network, we may provide you with the opportunity to switch to a Visa, MasterCard or Discover network by changing your preferences for that debit or prepaid card through your PayPal account profile.<\/p> Loyalty Cards <p>If you use the PayPal application on your mobile phone, you may store loyalty card numbers or bar codes, where applicable, for certain sellers in your PayPal account.\nWhen you store your loyalty card numbers or bar codes in your PayPal account, you will earn any rewards, subject to the seller’s loyalty card terms and conditions, at the time you make your payment to the merchant by presenting the stored loyalty card number or bar code to the seller at the point of sale.\nIt is your responsibility to make sure you have entered your loyalty card information correctly and that you update it as necessary.\nIt is also your responsibility to ensure that you are receiving the rewards to which you are entitled.\nPayPal is not responsible for managing your loyalty card account by offering this service and any questions about your loyalty card or associated rewards program should be directed to the seller who offers the card.<\/p> PayPal’s Purchase Protection Program <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal’s Purchase Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Purchase Protection program.\nPayPal’s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal’s Purchase Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal’s Purchase Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn’t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn’t what you ordered (referred to as a “Significantly Not as Described” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Purchase Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <strong>\n<em>will not<\/em>\n<\/strong> qualify for a refund under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program for an Item Not Received claim, if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller’s physical store, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions, or<\/li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller’s description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as “new” but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn’t receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as “used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Purchase Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller’s store location, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government agency.<\/li>\n<li>Stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal Payments.<\/li>\n<li>Payments sent using PayPal to any bill payment service.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay or guest checkout transactions (i.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account).<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Transaction eligibility for PayPal’s Purchase Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Purchase Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment and follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you’re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> to pursue a claim under our Purchase Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.\n<\/p>\n<p>Step 3: <strong>Respond to PayPal’s requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4: <strong>Comply with PayPal’s shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you’re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery means:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For transactions that total less than $750 U.S.\ndollars (or the currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or zip code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.<\/li>\n<li>For transactions that total $750 U.S.\ndollar (or the currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Signature confirmation currency thresholds

MXN<\/p>\n<p>U.S.\nDollar:<\/p>\n<p>750 USD<\/p>\n<p>Step 5: <strong>PayPal will make a final decision <\/strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don’t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Purchase Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can’t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we’ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won’t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).<\/p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller’s return policy.<\/p> Selling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services <p>&nbsp;<\/p> Receiving personal payments <p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.<\/li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you money using the “send money to a friend or family member.” If you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account’s ability to accept payments from friends or family members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> No surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Presentation of PayPal and Pay with Venmo <p>You must treat PayPal and/or Venmo as payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale where PayPal or Venmo branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal or Venmo services or marks.\n<\/p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal or Venmo services or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal or Venmo services.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or Venmo services or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal or Venmo, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising, and other customer communications) you agree to display the PayPal or Venmo services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Taxes and information reporting <p>Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “taxes”).\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process.\nFor example, PayPal is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of payments for goods and services you receive each calendar year into all of your PayPal accounts associated with the same tax identification number if you receive more than $20,000 in payments for good and services and process more than 200 transactions involving goods or services through those PayPal accounts in the same calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Your customer service information, refunds and returns policy, and privacy policy <p>You must publish customer service information with clear instructions on how your customers can contact you.\nSuch instructions must include at least: (1) one active customer service email address or active customer service URL to file tickets for assistance and/or (2) one active customer service telephone number.\nSuch information must be readily accessible for review by your customers.<\/p>\n<p>You must publish a refunds and returns policy.<\/p>\n<p>You must publish a privacy policy, where required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal's Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you about payment reviews by email and/or through your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer’s account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes intended for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions, you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace’s or the third party application’s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> PayPal Giving Fund <p>If you are a charity and hold a PayPal account, you may be eligible to participate in PayPal Giving Fund programs.\nPayPal Giving Fund is a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code as a tax-exempt public charity (Federal Tax ID: 45-0931286).\nIf you meet the eligibility requirements in the <strong>Nonprofit Certification Policy<\/strong> and are either a “Public Charity” under Section 509(a) of the Code or a \"Private Operating Foundation\" under IRS regulations, you may be automatically enrolled with PayPal Giving Fund upon acceptance of this user agreement.\nYou will receive an email from us confirming your enrollment.\nYour relationship with PayPal Giving Fund will be governed by the <strong>Nonprofit User Agreement<\/strong>, including receiving email communications from PayPal Giving Fund about its current and future partners about its programs.\nYou can opt out of email communications at any time in your <strong>PayPal Giving Fund profile<\/strong>.\nIf you don’t want to be enrolled or receive donations from PayPal Giving Fund, you can opt-out at any time by <strong>contacting us<\/strong>.\nFor more information, please see <strong>PayPal Giving Fund’s Policies<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a “card not present” transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Accepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer’s account through preauthorized transfers either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a “billing agreement,” \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"<\/p> If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers: <p>You must:<\/p>\n<p>You must not:<\/p>\n<p>Get each buyer’s prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.<\/p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer’s written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.<\/p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancelation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.<\/p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.<\/p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer’s option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.<\/p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the country of the buyer’s account or the currency of their card;<\/li>\n<li>whether you are registered as a charitable organization and have active 501(c)(3) status.\nYour 501(c)(3) status must be documented with PayPal to receive the rates applicable to charitable organizations, and those rates will apply only after you document your status with us.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Standard transaction fees <p>The fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Standard Transaction Fees table, with the fees applicable to charitable organizations founds on the Standard Transaction Fees for Charitable Organizations table for the charitable fees.\nPlease note that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 21 days’ advance notice for personal PayPal accounts and at least 5 days’ advance notice for business PayPal accounts of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.<\/li>\n<li>If you refund a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned.<\/li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Here or PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Micropayments fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the Micropayment Fees table will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of Standard Transaction Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal’s Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nYou may be able to choose to send payments to PayPal accounts, Venmo accounts, or both.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a business PayPal account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand<\/li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.<\/p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay service, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.<\/p>\n<p>You can send money through Payouts or Mass Pay even if your receiver does not have a PayPal or Venmo account, as applicable, using their email address or mobile number.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a relevant account, they can claim it by opening one.\nIf they don’t claim it, it will be refunded to you in thirty (30) days.\nPayPal is not liable for amounts sent by you in error.\nPayPal shall have no responsibility to reverse any payout payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Your responsibility to notify PayPal of pricing or fee errors <p>Once you have access to any account statement(s) or other account activity information made available to you by PayPal with respect to your business account(s), you will have ninety (90) days to notify PayPal in writing of any errors or discrepancies with respect to the pricing or other fees applied by PayPal.\nIf you do not notify PayPal within such timeframe, you accept such information as accurate, and PayPal shall have no obligation to make any corrections.\nFor the purposes of this provision, such pricing or fee errors or discrepancies are different than Unauthorized Transactions and other electronic transfer<strong> Errors<\/strong> which are each subject to different notification timeframes as set forth herein.<\/p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks <p>&nbsp;<\/p> General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account.\nIf a currency conversion is necessary (for example if the balance in your Cash Account or your business PayPal account for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, or if the buyer paid in a different currency), PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you refund a payment for goods or services, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned to you.\nThe amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Purchase Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.<\/li>\n<li>You lose a Venmo Protected Purchase Program claim.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.<\/li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven’t opted out).<\/li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer’s bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.<\/li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized<\/li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement or any other agreement between you and PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated or reversed for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of that payment may be calculated in that currency, using the PayPal transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) that applies at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account doesn’t cover the payment amount due plus the fees, we may use any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to cover the amount due.\nIf the payment methods linked to your PayPal account don’t cover the amount due, this will result in a negative balance.\nA negative balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your balance to resolve it.\nIf you don’t, PayPal may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover the amount due from you;<\/li>\n<li>take any or all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Dispute fees <p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> table, then the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> amount will be determined when the dispute case is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your dispute ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July, and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions<\/strong>.\nand all chargebacks from the buyer’s card issuer or reversals from the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>If your dispute ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.<\/p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s<strong> Resolution Center<\/strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal’s Seller Protection<\/strong> program.<\/li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a Standard Dispute fee.<\/li>\n<li>Decided in your favor by PayPal or your issuer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s<strong> Resolution Center<\/strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees<\/strong> may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.<\/p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Chargeback fees <p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, then PayPal will charge you a <strong>Chargeback fee<\/strong> for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee with apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.<\/p> The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee table and will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Chargeback fee<\/strong> table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal’s Purchase Protection program, Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program, and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection available to buyers in each of those countries.\nBuyers’ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about PayPal’s protection programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer’s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding user agreement.\nYou can find information on Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program in Venmo’s user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program in any country, or under Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay’s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What’s eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal’s Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal’s Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount for debit and credit card-funded transactions.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal’s Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an “Unauthorized Transaction” claim), and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by Paypal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They didn’t receive the item from you (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal’s Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal’s Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the United States.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for

Seller Protection so long as the buyer paid for the transaction in person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a

valid proof of shipping and delivery.\n<ul>\n<li>The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person.\nprovided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Center.\nIf you do not respond to PayPal’s request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>Provide

program.\nPayPal will make a decision, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements, any information or documentation provided during the resolution process, or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Item Not Received additional requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection program for a buyer’s Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked “eligible” for PayPal’s Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, the sale must meet the <strong>basic requirements<\/strong> and the following additional requirements: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements<\/li>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at

signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods: <p>Proof of

PayPal, its customers and others at any time in our sole discretion.\nThe actions we may take include, but are not limited to, the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terminate this user agreement, limit your PayPal account (and any linked Cash Account), and/or close or suspend your PayPal account (and any linked Cash Account), immediately and without penalty to us;<\/li>\n<li>Refuse to provide the PayPal services to you in the future;<\/li>\n<li>Limit your access to our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our

to send money or make withdrawals;<\/li>\n<li>Hold the balance in your Cash Account, the balance in your business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, for up to 180 days if reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability or if you have violated our Acceptable Use Policy;<\/li>\n<li>Suspend your eligibility for PayPal’s Purchase Protection program and/or PayPal’s Seller Protection program;<\/li>\n<li>Contact buyers who have purchased goods or

damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.\nYou acknowledge and agree that $2,500.00 U.S.\ndollars per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.\nPayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we close your PayPal account or terminate your use of the PayPal services for any reason, we’ll provide you with notice of our actions and make any unrestricted funds held in the balance of your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account or in the balance of your business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, available for withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by PayPal, any PayPal customer, or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this agreement, and/or your use of the PayPal services.<\/p> Holds, Limitations, and Reserves <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What are holds, limitations and reserves <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nUnless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we’ll provide you with notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these actions.\nTo request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Center or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.<\/p>\n<p>In order to facilitate PayPal’s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal’s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.<\/li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.<\/li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on PayPal’s risk decisions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe’ll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.<\/p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 21 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you’ve uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 21 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we’ll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved (but no longer than 180 days).<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds related to Marketplace transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third party directly.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on disputed transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we’ll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we’ll remove the funds from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we’ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.<\/li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you’ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Reserves placed on business PayPal accounts <p>We may place a reserve on your business PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your business PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your business PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the money in your business PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your business PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your business PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve<\/strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve<\/strong> is a specific minimum amount of money that you’re required to keep available in the balance of your business PayPal account at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, the funds will be shown as \"pending\" and we’ll notify you of the terms of the reserve.<br> If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you of the new terms.<br>\n<\/p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place longer than 180 days.<\/p> PayPal User Agreement Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is an Unauthorized Transaction <p>An “Unauthorized Transaction” occurs when money is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction <p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Reporting an Unauthorized Transaction <p>If you believe your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen, please contact PayPal customer service immediately or call: (888) 221-1161 or write: PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.<\/p>\n<p>Tell us AT ONCE if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using your login information or by other means.\nYou could lose all the money in your PayPal account.\nIf you tell us within 60 days after we provide you your PayPal account statement showing transfers you did not make, you will be eligible for 100% protection for Unauthorized Transactions.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if your PayPal account statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made with your PayPal login information or by other means, tell us at once.\nIf you do not tell us within 60 days after we provided the statement to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.\nIf a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods.<\/p> Error Resolution <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is an Error <p>An “Error” means the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When money is either incorrectly taken from your PayPal account or incorrectly placed into your PayPal account, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>An incorrect amount is credited to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.<\/li>\n<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You request receipt or periodic statement documents that PayPal is required to provide to you.<\/li>\n<li>You request information concerning preauthorized (recurring) transfers to your PayPal account that PayPal is required to provide to you.<\/li>\n<li>You request additional information or clarification concerning a transfer to or from your PayPal account, including a request you make to determine whether an error has occurred.<\/li>\n<li>You inquire about the status of a pending transfer to or from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You request documentation or other information, unless the request is for a duplicate copy for tax or other record-keeping purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered an Error <p>The following are NOT considered Errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Routine inquiries about the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Requests for duplicate documentation or other information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> In case of Errors or questions about your electronic transfers <p>Telephone us at (888) 221-1161, contact us through the PayPal Resolution Center.\nor write us at PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.\n<\/p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name and account number (if any).<\/li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.<\/li>\n<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.<\/p>\n<p>We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly.\nIf we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, we will credit your PayPal account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nFor new PayPal accounts, we may take up to 20 Business Days to credit your PayPal account for the amount you think is in error.<\/p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.<\/p> Processing Errors <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover.\nIf the error results in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You receiving less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.<\/li>\n<li>You receiving more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.<\/li>\n<li>Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: <ul>\n<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;<\/li>\n<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/li>\n<li>the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Processing errors are not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.<\/li>\n<li>Delays based on a payment review.<\/li>\n<li>Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.<\/li>\n<li>Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount of money that you are sending).<\/li>\n<\/ul> Remittance Transfer Errors <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is a Remittance Transfer <p>You may be protected for certain errors when you send money using a PayPal account outside of the U.S.\nA “Remittance Transfer” is a transaction that meets the following criteria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The payment is sent from a personal PayPal account that is used primarily for personal, family or household purposes,<\/li>\n<li>The payment is made for personal, family or household purposes,<\/li>\n<li>The payment is made using the send money feature through your PayPal account,<\/li>\n<li>The payment amount equals or exceeds $15 USD (excluding fees charged to you) or the foreign currency equivalent calculated using exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction, and<\/li>\n<li>The recipient of the payment has a PayPal account in a country outside the U.S.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Payments that you make at a merchant website or location by selecting PayPal as a payment option are not “Remittance Transfers.”<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What qualifies as a Remittance Transfer Error <p>A <strong>“Remittance Transfer Error”<\/strong> occurs if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You paid an incorrect amount to send the Remittance Transfer.\nFor example, you were charged more than the total shown on the remittance transfer receipt you received (unless the total shown on the receipt was an estimate, and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes).<\/li>\n<li>PayPal made a computational or bookkeeping error, such as a miscalculation of the amount the recipient received.<\/li>\n<li>The amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt was not made available to the recipient, unless: <ul>\n<li>we stated in the remittance transfer receipt that we used estimates and the difference in the amount received and the amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, or<\/li>\n<li>the problem was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside our control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Funds were available to the recipient later than the date of availability that was disclosed to you on the remittance transfer receipt or were not delivered, unless: <ul>\n<li>extraordinary circumstances outside our control caused the delay, and we could not reasonably anticipate those circumstances,<\/li>\n<li>delays resulted from fraud screenings, or were caused by requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Controls or similar requirements, or<\/li>\n<li>you (or someone assisting you) made the transfer with fraudulent intent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>You request documentation or information concerning the Remittance Transfer, such as information required to determine if a Remittance Transfer Error occurred.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered a Remittance Transfer Error <p>The following are NOT considered Remittance Transfer Errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An inquiry about the status of a Remittance Transfer, except where the funds from the transfer were not made available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability,<\/li>\n<li>A request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes,<\/li>\n<li>A change requested by the designated recipient, or<\/li>\n<li>A change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the

the right to suspend or terminate this user agreement, access to or use of its websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by

held in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Security interest <p>As security for the performance of your obligations under this user agreement, you grant to PayPal a lien on, and security interest in and to, funds held in your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Amounts owed to PayPal <p>If the balance in your PayPal account becomes negative for any reason, that negative balance represents an amount that you owe to PayPal.\nPayPal may deduct these amounts from funds that are added to your PayPal account later, either by you or from payments you receive.\nIf you have more than one PayPal account, we may set off a negative balance in one PayPal account against a balance in your other PayPal account(s), including a Cash Account.\nIf you continue using your PayPal account when it has a negative balance, you authorize PayPal to combine the negative balance with any debit or transaction sent from your account when that combination is disclosed to you in advance of initiating the debit or transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold funds in a PayPal account in multiple currencies, and the balance for one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, PayPal may set off the negative balance by using funds you maintain in a different currency.\nIf you have a negative balance in non-U.S.\ndollars for a period of 21 days or longer, PayPal will convert this negative balance to U.S.\ndollars.\nIn either case, a currency conversion will be necessary, and PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the above, if you have a past due amount owed to us, our affiliates, or eBay, PayPal may debit your PayPal account to pay any amounts that are past due.\nThis includes amounts owed by using our various products such as Venmo, Xoom or Braintree.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Insolvency proceedings <p>If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as

discretion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> No waiver <p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under this user agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.<\/p> Indemnification and Limitation of Liability <p>In this section, we use the term “PayPal” to refer to PayPal, Inc., our parent PayPal Holdings, Inc., and our affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, joint venturers, service providers and suppliers.\nOur affiliates include each entity that we control, we are controlled by or we are under common control with.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Indemnification <p>\n<strong>You must indemnify PayPal for actions related to your PayPal account and your use of the PayPal

over the products or services provided by sellers who accept PayPal as a payment method, and PayPal cannot ensure that a buyer or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so.\nPayPal does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the PayPal services, and operation of our websites, software, or systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control.\nPayPal will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and check issuances are processed in a timely manner but PayPal makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the PayPal services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or the U.S.\nor international mail service.\nSome states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Release of PayPal <p>If you have a dispute with any other PayPal account holder, you release PayPal from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out

<p>You and PayPal agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us will be resolved in accordance with the Agreement to Arbitrate provisions set forth below.\nPlease read this information carefully.\nAmong other things it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Affects your rights and will impact how claims you and we have against each other are

days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If a dispute arises between you and PayPal, acting as either a buyer or a seller, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns.\nIf we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, we aim to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.\nDisputes between you and PayPal regarding the PayPal services may be reported to customer service online through the PayPal Help Center at any time, or by calling (888) 221-1161 from Mon-Fri 5:00 AM to 10:00 PM PT and Sat-Sun

arise between you and PayPal, including without limitation federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\nThis Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em> Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and PayPal agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.\nUnless both you and PayPal agree otherwise, the arbitrator(s) may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding.\nAlso, the arbitrator(s) may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s).\nAny relief awarded cannot affect other PayPal customers.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Arbitration Procedures<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.\nHowever, the arbitrator(s) can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.\nThe arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of this user agreement as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator(s) to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (referred to as the \"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other party, by certified mail, a completed Notice of Dispute.\nYou should send this notice to PayPal at: PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.\nPayPal will send any notice to you to the address we have on file associated with your PayPal account.\nit is your responsibility to keep your address up to date.\nAll information called for in the notice must be provided including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.<\/p>\n<p>If you and PayPal are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, you or PayPal may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nA form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at www.adr.org.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or PayPal may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and PayPal subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.\nIn cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or PayPal may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator(s) require otherwise.\nAny settlement offer made by you or PayPal shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator(s).<\/p>\n<p>The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PayPal customers, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PayPal customer to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Costs of Arbitration<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, PayPal will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.\nAny request for payment of fees by PayPal should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and PayPal will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, PayPal will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator(s) deem necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive.\nIn the event the arbitrator(s) determine the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse PayPal for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by PayPal on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Severability<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\nIf a court decides that any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in court.\nAll other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall be arbitrated under its terms.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Opt-Out Procedure<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a new PayPal customer, you can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice.\nThe opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time.\nYou must mail the opt-out notice to PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.<\/p>\n<p>For your convenience, we are providing an opt-out notice form you must complete and mail to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nYou must complete this form by providing all the information it calls for, including your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the PayPal account(s) to which the opt-out applies.\nYou must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective.\nThis procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the user agreement will continue to apply.\nOpting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.<\/p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Future Amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate<\/i>\n<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision in the user agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against PayPal prior to the effective date of the amendment.\nThe amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by this Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal.\nWe will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on www.paypal.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing notice through email.\nIf you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your PayPal account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.<\/p> Intellectual Property

for ways to help keep you even more secure.\nSo stay on the lookout for some of these common scams:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spoofing: a scammer sends forged or faked electronic documents or emails falsely claiming to be PayPal or coming from PayPal but asks you to send money outside your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Relative in Need: a scammer impersonates a family member (commonly grandchildren) and claims there is an emergency requiring you to send money.<\/li>\n<li>Lottery or Prize: a scammer informs you that you’ve won a lottery or prize and must send money in order to claim it.<\/li>\n<li>Debt Collection: a scammer impersonates a debt collector and induces you to send money using threats or intimidation.<\/li>\n<li>Employment Related: a scammer instructs you to send money in connection with a fraudulent offer of employment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Always use common sense when sending money.\nIf something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\nOnly send money for yourself and not for others.\nRemember that if you don’t send the payment through your PayPal account, you’re not covered by PayPal Purchase Protection.\nPlease let us know immediately if you believe someone is trying to scam or defraud you by contacting us.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Dormant accounts <p>If you do not log in to your PayPal account for two or more years, PayPal may close your PayPal

agreement will be effective for all users as of October 31, 2020.<\/p> Welcome to PayPal! <p>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal Pte.\nLtd., a Singaporean company governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nIf you are an individual, you must be a resident of one of the countries/regions listed on the <strong>PayPal Worldwide<\/strong> page and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your country/region of residence to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of one of the countries/regions listed on the <strong>PayPal Worldwide<\/strong> page to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nYou also agree to comply with the following additional policies and each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>Alternative Payment Methods Terms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, the terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may amend this user agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it on our website, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you with at least 14 days notice.\nAll future changes set out in the Policy Updates page already published on the Legal Agreements page at the time you register for the PayPal services are incorporated by reference into this user agreement and will take effect as specified in the Policy Update.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not agree to the revised terms and conditions, you must stop using the PayPal services, close your account and terminate your relationship with us without cost or penalty.\nThis user agreement will continue to apply to your previous use of our services.<\/p> About our main business <p>PayPal is a payment services provider and acts as such by creating, hosting, maintaining and providing our PayPal services to you via the internet.\nOur services allow you to send payments to anyone with a PayPal account, and, where available, to receive payments.\nOur service availability varies by country/region.\nYou can see what services are available in your country/region by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>The PayPal services are offered by PayPal Pte.\nLtd.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consumer Advisory — PayPal Pte.\nLtd., the holder of the PayPal stored value facility, does not require the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\nConsumers (users) are advised to read the terms and conditions carefully.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement is not a solicitation of the PayPal services and PayPal is not targeting any country/region or market through this user agreement.<\/p> Opening an Account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.<\/p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive payments.<\/li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.<\/li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods.<\/li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods from others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>In order to open and maintain a PayPal account, you must list your correct country/region of residence and provide us with correct and updated account information, including but not limited to personal information, financial information, or other information related to you or your business.<\/p>\n<p>You must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p> Personal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send payments to family and friends, a personal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal account you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy goods and services.<\/li>\n<li>Send and request payments from friends and family.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>You can also use a personal account to receive payments for the sale of goods and services, but if you plan to use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should consider a business account.\nYou can convert your PayPal account from a personal account to a business account should circumstances change.<\/p> Business accounts <p>We recommend business accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business account, you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening, when you request certain new products and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business account.<\/strong>\n<\/p> Commercial Entity Agreement <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.<\/p> Third Party permissions <p>You must be the beneficial owner of your PayPal account, and conduct business only on behalf of yourself.<\/p>\n<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.\nIn some cases, you can do this when logged into your PayPal account – in other cases, you can do this directly with the third party.\nYou acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your PayPal account to this third party.<\/p>\n<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;<\/li>\n<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your PayPal account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.\nYou are liable to us for the actions that you authorize the third parties to carry out.\nYou will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost or penalty, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nYou must withdraw or transfer any PayPal balance from your PayPal account before closing it.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.\n<\/p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card or a bank account to your PayPal account as a payment method.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (i.e.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.<\/p> Holding a PayPal Balance <p>Any PayPal balance you hold represents an unsecured claim against PayPal.\nPayPal combines your balance with the balances of other users and invests those funds in liquid investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held separate from PayPal's corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.\nYou will not receive interest or other earnings on the amounts in your balance.\nYou agree PayPal shall own the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nYou agree to assign any rights to any interest derived from your funds to PayPal.<\/p> Adding or Withdrawing Funds Adding funds to your balance <p>You may use the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to fund transactions you make using your PayPal account.\nYou don't need a PayPal balance to buy something or send payments.\nYou can add funds your PayPal account from the bank account that's linked to your PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer to your PayPal account.\nThe amount transferred will be held as a balance in your PayPal account.\nCredit cards cannot be used to add funds to your PayPal balance.<\/p> Withdrawing funds from your balance <p>If you have a PayPal balance, log into your PayPal account to see which of these withdrawal options are available in your country/region:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it to a bank account linked to your PayPal account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>transferring it to your debit or credit card, where available.\nor<\/li>\n<li>requesting a physical cheque through the mail, where available.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on the country/region in which your account is registered, you may be able to withdraw your funds through a third party service provider.\nPlease see terms of such third party for information regarding currency conversions.<\/p>\n<p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or the negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit card or debit card information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may charge a fee to make a transfer to your bank account.\nIf your debit card is eligible to receive withdrawals from your PayPal account, you will be provided the option to use it when you transfer funds out of your PayPal balance, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for personal accounts) page and the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business accounts) page.\nThe applicable fees will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, we will send physical cheques through the mail only to confirmed addresses, unless we have verified your PayPal account.\nWe will not send cheques to post office boxes.\nIf you would like us to send a cheque to an address that does not meet these criteria, you must contact customer service and provide the documentation that we request to verify your association with the address.\nIf you fail to cash a cheque within 180 Days of the date of issuance, we will return the funds to your balance (minus a fee).<\/p> Managing Your Balance in Multiple Currencies Holding multiple currencies <p>Your PayPal balance may be held in any of the currencies supported by PayPal, and you may hold a balance in more than one of these currencies at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your PayPal account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the balance into another currency.\nIf you convert the balance in your account, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of your balance that you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.<\/li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the balance in the opening currency of your account or such other currency that PayPal supports for withdrawal in your registered country/region.\nIn order to withdraw the balance in your account which is held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate, including our currency conversion fee, will be used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To receive funds in a currency that your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your PayPal account in that currency or convert the balance into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in your PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.<\/p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).<\/p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe currency conversion fee applicable can be found on our fees page under the heading Currency conversion fees.<\/p>Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and involves a currency conversion by PayPal, you consent to and authorize us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis currency preference selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and the fees they may charge.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use your existing PayPal balance or your linked bank account is the payment method.<\/p> Account Statements Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSending payments and buying Sending payments to or Receiving payments from a Friend or Family Member Sending payments <p>In some countries/regions, you can send funds to a friend or family member from your PayPal account using the send payments feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called personal payments or peer-to-peer/P2P payments).\n<\/p>\n<p>Visit our Available Services by Country/Region of Residence list to see which services are available in your country/region of residence or log into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>You can send funds to a friend or family member even if they don't have a PayPal account at the time you send them funds, using their email address or mobile number, in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending funds does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't claim it, it will be refunded to you.\nReceiving funds from a friend or family member is described under <strong>Receiving Funds<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of funds you can send, including funds you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging in to your PayPal account.\nWe may increase your sending limits if you complete the same steps to verify your information as is required for the removal of withdrawal limits.<\/p>\n<p>When you send funds to a friend or family member, one of three things may happen: they may accept, decline or fail to claim the funds.\nIf they either decline to accept the funds or don't claim them within 30 days of the date they are sent, the funds (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal Credit as the payment method, or<\/li>\n<li>Your PayPal balance, if you used your PayPal balance as the payment method or a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Receiving payments <p>If a friend or family member sends funds to you, the funds will appear in your PayPal balance.\nTo receive funds in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the funds into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p> Fees for Sending payments to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending funds can be found in our Sending funds table and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send funds to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert your PayPal balance from one currency to another, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you send funds to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party's product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.<\/p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal in any currency that the seller accepts, and that PayPal supports, using the funds in your PayPal balance, or using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer's website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Sending a payment to a seller for good or services.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller's physical store.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.<\/p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third-party websites or applications, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>American Express may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as branded airlines and certain travel merchants;<\/li>\n<li>Some credit cards may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as those in the gambling industry.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Credit cards cannot be used to send personal payments or to top up your PayPal balance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied as described in the How we convert currency section and will be determined at the time the payment is processed.<\/p>\nFees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you don't pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>Your credit card or debit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for transactions.<\/p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don't clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\nAutomatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows the seller to take funds from your PayPal account with your authorization on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>You may cancel an automatic payment up to 3 Business Days before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the PayPal Help Centre.\nOnce an automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller funds for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for and you may be required to pay the seller through alternative means.<\/p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs a currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal's currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal balance.\nIf you used a bank account as the payment method for the transaction, we will refund the payment to your bank account, or to your PayPal balance if we cannot refund it to your bank account.\nFor purchases you make in a seller's store location that you paid for using your PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will be refunded to your PayPal balance.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal performed a currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>within 1 day of the date of the original payment, the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) used at the time of the original payment will apply.<\/li>\n<li>beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) on the date of the refund will apply.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\nThis means that you may not receive the full amount of your original payment due to the fees above and fluctuations in currency conversion rates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Payments will be refunded in the currency you paid, or if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.<\/p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction Selecting a preferred payment method <p>In certain countries, you can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.<\/p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions and automatic payments with a seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the \"Manage\" link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.<\/p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.<\/p> Sending payments to friends and family <p>When you send payments to friends and family using your PayPal balance (if available) or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the \"Change\" link on the Send Payments page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send the payment.<\/p>\nAutomatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way to pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can select a payment method for future purchases with a particular seller either at the time of creating the agreement or in your account settings.\nFor example, you can instruct your monthly movie subscription service to always charge your credit card for the monthly cost.<\/p>\n<p>If your chosen payment method is unavailable (e.g.\ncredit card expired), a particular agreement with a seller does not provide for the ability to specify a payment method, or if you have not designated a payment method for future transactions with a seller, the payment method used will be in the following order, as applicable: 1.\nbalance.\n2.\nbank account (instant transfer).\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\ndebit card.\n6.\ncredit card.\nand 7.\neCheque.<\/p>\n<p>You can cancel any agreement in your account settings.<\/p>\nBank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.<\/p> eCheque <p>eCheque is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside of your country/region.<\/p>\n<p>If eCheque is your preferred payment method, it will be used to fund your PayPal payment, even if you have a balance.<\/p> PayPal’s Buyer Protection Program PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal's Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Buyer Protection program.\nPayPal's original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal's Buyer Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal's Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an \"Item Not Received\" claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a \"Significantly Not as Described\" claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Buyer Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions.<\/p>\nItem Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>will not<\/em> qualify for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program for an Item Not Received claim if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller's store location, or<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to your address, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p> Significantly Not As Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller's description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as \"new\" but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\nit is counterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn't receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was materially damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially similar to the seller's description of it.<\/li>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as \"used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIneligible items and transactions under PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in all or part of a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller's store location.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government agency.<\/li>\n<li>Stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal payments.\n<\/li>\n<li>Payments sent using PayPal to any bill payment service.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay or guest checkout transactions (i.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account).<\/li>\n<li>Send payment transactions where the sender pays the PayPal transaction fee.<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nTransaction eligibility for PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.\n<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Centre within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, and follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nOur online dispute resolution process <p>If you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Centre to pursue a claim under our Buyer Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 1:<\/strong>\n<strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 2:<\/strong>\n<strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the Resolution Centre.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 3:<\/strong>\n<strong>Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 4:<\/strong>\n<strong>Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you're filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.<\/p>\nProof of delivery means: <p>For transactions that total less than $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/ or postal code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.<\/p>\n<p>For transactions that total $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery (except for buyers having a PayPal account registered: in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Iceland, Israel, or Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Signature<\/strong>\n<strong>confirmation currency

USD<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 5: PayPal will make a final decision<\/strong> (including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.<\/p>\n<p>In the event that PayPal makes a final decision in favour of the buyer or seller, each party must comply with PayPal's decision.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal finds in favour of a buyer, PayPal will reimburse the buyer for the full purchase price of the item and original shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>In a seller loses a claim, the seller will not receive a refund on the PayPal fees associated with the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If a seller loses a Significantly Not as Described claim due to the item sold being counterfeit, the seller will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you will not receive the item back.<\/p>\nDispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a credit card or debit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don't qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Buyer Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can't do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we'll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won't affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).\nBefore contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller's return policy.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSelling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services Receiving personal payments <p>The ability to receive payments varies by country/region.\nYou can determine whether you have the ability to receive payments by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.<\/li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you a personal payment for a purchase.\nIf you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account's ability to accept payments from friends or family members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Terms.<\/p>\nNo surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.<\/p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, wherever PayPal’s branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal’s services or marks.<\/p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal service as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over any PayPal service.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising and other customer communications), you agree to display the PayPal services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.<\/p>\nTaxes, information reporting <p>Some of our fees may be subject to applicable taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including, for example, value-added tax, sales tax, income tax, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, \"taxes\") and, unless expressly noted, our fees are exclusive of applicable taxes.\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.<\/p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy, where required by law.<\/p>\nPayment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you by email and/or through your PayPal account.<\/p> In-store payments <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace's or the third party application's buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a \"card not present\" transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.<\/p>\nAccepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer's account through preauthorized payments either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer, \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers:<\/p>\n<p>You must:<\/p>\n<p>You must not:<\/p>\n<p>Get each buyer's prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.<\/p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer's written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancellation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.<\/p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.<\/p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer's option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.<\/p> Automatic Transfer Countries <p>If you are a resident of an Automatic Transfer Country, then you have the ability to receive payments, but you must withdraw the full amount of your payment through an available withdrawal method.\nIf you do not do so, the amounts will be automatically withdrawn from your PayPal account to your withdrawal method on a regular basis.\nFor additional terms regarding Automatic Transfer, please click here.<\/p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments Standard transactions fees <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on the buyer's country/region.\nThe fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Commercial Payments Fees table.\nPlease note that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 14 days' advance notice of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.<\/li>\n<li>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.<\/li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Merchant rate <p>To qualify for our merchant rate, you must submit a one-time application, have a qualifying monthly sales volume, and have a business account in good standing.\nTo view Merchant rate criteria click here.<\/p>\nMicropayments Fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10 USD.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative PayPal balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the <strong>Micropayment Fees table<\/strong> will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of the Commercial Payments Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.<\/p>\n<p>By applying for Micropayments for Digital Goods, you agree that for digital goods transactions you receive up to the amounts in the <strong>table<\/strong>, then if a buyer opens a Dispute, PayPal may reverse the transaction, and remove the funds from your account without requiring the buyer to escalate the dispute to a claim.<\/p>\nPayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal's Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal business account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand<\/li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.\n<\/p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay services, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.<\/p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee described below).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account in the same currency as the original transaction.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.\n(This will not apply to residents of Mainland China who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.)<\/p>\n<p>The buyer's account will be credited with the full payment amount, or a portion of the payment amount in the event of a partial refund, we'll retain the fixed fee portion of the fees you paid, and the amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.<\/p>\nPayments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Buyer Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.<\/li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven't opted out).<\/li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer's bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.<\/li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized.<\/li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement, the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy or any other agreement between you and PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of the payment sent to you may be calculated in that currency, using PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover your liability for the payment amount plus the fees, then this will result in a negative PayPal balance.\nAny negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your PayPal balance to eliminate it.\nIf you do not do so, PayPal may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>recover any amounts due to PayPal by debiting your balance;<\/li>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you;<\/li>\n<li>take any and all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nDispute fees<p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout<strong>.\n<\/strong>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee <\/strong>rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee <\/strong>rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> amount will be determined when the dispute is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your disputes ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions<\/strong>\n<strong>, <\/strong>and all chargebacks from the buyer’s card issuer or reversals from the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>If your Disputes Ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.<\/p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee <\/strong>for disputes that are<em>:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal’s Seller Protection<\/strong> program.<\/li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a <strong>Standard Dispute fee.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>Decided in your favour by PayPal or your issuer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees <\/strong>may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.<\/p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.<\/p>\n<p>This Dispute fees section does not apply to residents of Malaysia who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\nChargeback fees<p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, PayPal will charge you a chargeback fee for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee will apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.<\/p>\n<p>The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is the amount specified on the Chargeback Fees table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the Chargeback fee table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.<\/p>\n<p>If a buyer files a chargeback, the card issuer, not PayPal, will determine who wins the chargeback.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee Table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the Chargeback Fee Table the fee assessed in your primary holding currency.<\/p>\nImpact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal's Buyer Protection program and if you sell goods and services to and receive payments from buyers with PayPal accounts in countries/regions other than your own, you should also be familiar with the PayPal Buyer Protection available to buyers in each of those countries/regions.\nBuyers' rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find this information for PayPal's programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer's location at the top of the page and referring to the applicable user agreement for that geography.<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal's Buyer Protection program in any country/region:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be required to reimburse PayPal for your liability.<\/li>\n<li>Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back), and the PayPal fees that you were charged for the transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay's decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover such claim.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>We offer Seller Protection based on the Seller Protection program for the country/region you selected when you opened your account.\nThe Seller Protection program for the following countries/regions are part of this user agreement.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Central Europe, Middle East and Africa<\/strong> (excluding Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other countries covered by a country/region-specific User Agreement)<\/li>\n<\/ul> What's eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under <strong>Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks<\/strong>, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal's Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal's Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize or benefit from funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an \"<strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>\" and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They did not receive the item from you (referred to as an \"<strong>Item Not Received<\/strong>\" claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer's bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal's Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the <strong>Impact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers<\/strong>.<\/p>\nBasic requirements<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You provide us with valid proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a tangible item except for items subject to the Intangible Goods Additional Requirements.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Centre.\nIf you do not respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>You must accept payment from a PayPal account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).<\/li>\n<li>The payment must be marked “eligible” or “partially eligible” in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims, for PayPal's Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nItem Not Received additional requirement<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection program for a buyer's Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked \"eligible\" or \"partially eligible\" for PayPal's Seller Protection on the transaction details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements:<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third-party or if you have a native app integration.<\/li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>Paid standard transaction fees on the sale.<\/li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of shipment or delivery for Intangible Goods.<\/li>\n<li>Provide signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table.\nIf the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nEstablishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods:<\/p>\n<p>Proof of shipment<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery<\/p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the transaction details page<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of delivery and \"delivered\" status of the item or service.<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<li>Signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes exceeds) the fixed amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table .\nSignature confirmation is online documentation, viewable at the shipping company's website, indicating that the item was signed for (save for Sellers having a PayPal Account registered in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT<\/strong>: Your choice of carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.\nPlease ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide ‘delivered' status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for intangible goods:<\/p>\n<p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.\nCompelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Received or accessed by the

reserve.<\/p>\n<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.<\/p>\n<p>In order to facilitate PayPal’s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal’s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.<\/p>\nHolds<p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the funds shall not be available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.<\/li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.<\/li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHolds based on PayPal’s risk decisions<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe'll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.\n<\/p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 30 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account unless PayPal has a reason to continue to hold the payment.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you've uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 30 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we'll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved.<\/p>\nHolds related to Marketplace transactions<p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third-party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third-party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third-party directly.<\/p>\nHolds based on disputed transactions<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we'll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we'll remove the funds from your PayPal account.<\/p>\nAccount Limitations<p>Limitations prevent you from completing certain actions with your PayPal account, such as withdrawing, sending or receiving payments.\nThese limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why we may limit your access to your PayPal account or the PayPal services, and/or limit access to your funds, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we'll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.<\/li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you've received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks selling an entirely new or high cost product, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we limit access to your PayPal account, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and the opportunity to request restoration of access if, in our sole discretion, we deem it appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>\nReserves<p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some of the transactions will be shown as \"pending\" in your PayPal balance, and you will not be able to withdraw funds in a \"pending\" status, in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors, and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, we'll notify you of our actions and the terms of the reserve.<\/p>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve<\/strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the funds you receive on day 1 are held and then released on day 91, 10% of the funds you receive on day 2 are held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve<\/strong> is a specific minimum amount that you're required to keep available in your PayPal balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we'll notify you of the new terms.\n<\/p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place as long as reasonably necessary as determined by PayPal.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nLiability for Unauthorized Transactions Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n<\/p>\nWhat is an Unauthorized Transaction<p>An \"Unauthorized Transaction\" occurs when a payment is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.<\/p>\nWhat is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction<p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nReporting an Unauthorized Transaction<p>You should contact PayPal customer service immediately if you believe:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>there has been an Unauthorized Transaction sent from your account;<\/li>\n<li>there has been unauthorized access to your account;<\/li>\n<li>your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen.\nor<\/li>\n<li>any device you have used to access your PayPal account has been lost, stolen or deactivated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You must give us all the available information relating to circumstances of any Unauthorized Transactions, and/or misappropriated or unauthorized use of your account, and take all reasonable steps requested to assist PayPal in its investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If you notify us of an Unauthorized Transaction within 60 days of the transaction and we are satisfied that it was an Unauthorized Transaction, you will be eligible for 100% protection for the Unauthorized Transaction.<\/p> Error Resolution What is an Error<p>An \"Error\" means the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a processing error made by PayPal or its suppliers in which your PayPal account is mistakenly debited or credited, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.<\/li>\n<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nWhat is not considered an Error<p>The following are NOT considered errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>If you erroneously send a payment to the wrong party, or send a payment for the wrong amount (based on a typographical error, for example).\n(Your only recourse in this instance will be to contact the party to whom you sent the payment and ask them to refund the payment.\nPayPal will not reimburse you or reverse a payment that you have made in error.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIn case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers<p>Contact us at our Resolution Centre.<\/p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name, email address and account number (if any).<\/li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.<\/li>\n<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.\nWe will complete our investigation within 10 Business Days after we receive your notification of the suspected error.\nIf we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, we will credit your PayPal account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the provisional credit during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nWe will notify you of the provisional credit within 2 Business Days of the crediting.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not provisionally credit your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nFor new PayPal accounts (the first transaction from your account was less than 30 Business Days from the date you notify us), we may take up to 20 Business Days to complete the investigation.<\/p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation of our decision.\nIf you received a provisional credit, we will remove it from your account and notify you of the date and amount of the debit.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If we determine that there was an error, we will promptly credit the full amount into your account within 1 Business Day of our determination.\nOr, if you have already received a provisional credit, you will be allowed to retain those amounts.<\/p> Processing Errors <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover.\nIf the error results in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You receive less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.<\/li>\n<li>You receive more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.<\/li>\n<li>Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: <ul>\n<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;<\/li>\n<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/li>\n<li>the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Processing errors are not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.<\/li>\n<li>Delays based on a payment review.<\/li>\n<li>Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.<\/li>\n<li>Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount that you are sending).<\/li>\n<\/ul> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nOther Legal Terms Communications Between You and Us <p>You agree that PayPal and its affiliates may contact you by email for marketing purposes.\nYou may opt-out of receiving marketing communications when you open a PayPal account, by changing your account preferences or by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any PayPal email or receipt you receive from us.\nPlease allow up to 10 Business Days for the opt-out to take effect.\nWe will provide factual information about your account or the PayPal services, even if you have opted-out of receiving marketing communications.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide us your mobile phone number, you agree that PayPal and its affiliates may contact you at that number using autodialed or prerecorded message calls or text messages to: (i) inform you about your use of the PayPal services and/or service your PayPal accounts, (ii) investigate or prevent fraud, or (iii) collect a debt.\nWe will not use autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to contact you for marketing purposes unless we receive your prior consent.\nWe may share your mobile phone number with service providers with whom we contract to assist us with the activities listed above, but will not share your mobile phone number with third parties for their own purposes without your consent.\nYou do not have to agree to receive autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to your mobile phone number in order to use and enjoy the products and services offered by PayPal.\nYou can decline to receive autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to your mobile phone number in several ways, including, via an email transaction receipt, in your account settings, or by contacting PayPal Customer Service.\nHowever, we may still call you directly using other means if we need to speak with you.\nStandard telephone minute and text charges may apply.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal may communicate with you about any PayPal account or transaction information and the PayPal services electronically.\nIt is your responsibility to keep your primary email address up to date so that PayPal can communicate with you electronically.\nYou understand and agree that if PayPal sends you an electronic communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic communications, PayPal will be deemed to have provided the communication to you effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add PayPal to your email address book so that you will be able to view the communications we send to you.<\/p>\n<p>You can update your primary email address or street address at any time by logging into the PayPal website.\nIf your email address becomes invalid such that electronic communications sent to you by PayPal are returned, PayPal may deem your account to be inactive, and you will not be able to transact any activity using your PayPal Account until we receive a valid, working primary email address from you.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal reserves the right to close your account if you withdraw your consent to receive electronic communications.<\/p>\n<p>You will be considered to have received a communication from us, if it's delivered electronically, 24 hours after the time we post it to our website or email it to you.\nYou will be considered to have received a communication from us, if it's delivered by mail, 3 Business Days after we send it.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you're communicating with us about a matter where we've specified another notice address (for example, our Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors process), written notices to PayPal must be sent by postal mail to: PayPal Pte.\nLtd., Attention: Legal Department, 5 Temasek Boulevard #09-01, Suntec Tower Five, Singapore 038985.<\/p>\n<p>You understand and agree that, to the extent permitted by law, PayPal may, without further notice or warning, monitor or record telephone conversations you or anyone acting on your behalf has with PayPal or its agents for quality control and training purposes or for our own protection.\nYou acknowledge and understand that while your communications with PayPal may be overheard, monitored, or recorded not all telephone lines or calls may be recorded by PayPal, and PayPal does not guarantee that recordings of any particular telephone calls will be retained or retrievable.<\/p> PayPal's Rights PayPal suspension and termination rights <p>PayPal, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to suspend or terminate this user agreement, access to or use of its websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the PayPal services for any reason and at any time upon notice to you and, upon termination of this user agreement, the payment to you of any unrestricted funds held in your PayPal balance.<\/p> Security interest <p>As security for the performance of your obligations under this user agreement, you grant to PayPal a lien on, and security interest in and to, your PayPal balance in the possession of PayPal.<\/p>\nAmounts owed to PayPal <p>If your PayPal balance becomes negative for any reason, that negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to PayPal.\nPayPal may set off these amounts from funds that are subsequently added to your PayPal account, either by you or from payments you receive.\nIf you have more than one PayPal account, we may set off a negative PayPal balance in one PayPal account against a PayPal balance in your other PayPal account(s).\nIf you continue using your PayPal account when it has a negative balance, you authorize PayPal to combine the negative balance with any debit or transaction sent from your account when that combination is disclosed to you in advance of initiating the debit or transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold funds in a PayPal account in multiple currencies, and the balance for one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, PayPal may set off the negative PayPal balance by using funds you maintain in a different currency.\nIf you have a negative balance in non-relevant currency for a period of 21 days or longer, PayPal will convert this negative balance to relevant currency.\nIn either case, a currency conversion will be necessary, and PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the above, if you have a past due amount owed to PayPal, our affiliates, or eBay, PayPal may debit your PayPal account to pay any amounts that are past due.\nThis includes amounts owed by using our various products such as Xoom or Braintree.<\/p>\nInsolvency proceedings<p>If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of any bankruptcy or insolvency law, we'll be entitled to recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this user agreement.<\/p>\nAssumption of rights<p>If PayPal invalidates and reverses a payment that you made to a recipient (either at your initiative or otherwise), you agree that PayPal assumes your rights against the recipient and third parties related to the payment, and may pursue those rights directly or on your behalf, in PayPal's discretion.<\/p>\nNo waiver<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under this user agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.<\/p> Indemnification and Limitation of Liability <p>In this section, we use the term \"PayPal\" to refer to PayPal Pte.\nLtd.\nand our affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, joint ventures, service providers and suppliers.\nOur affiliates include each entity that we control, we are controlled by or we are under common control with.<\/p>\nIndemnification<p>You must indemnify PayPal for actions related to your PayPal account and your use of the PayPal services.\nYou agree to defend, indemnify and hold PayPal harmless from any claim or demand (including reasonable legal fees) made or incurred by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this user agreement, your improper use of the PayPal services, your violation of any law or the rights of a third party and/or the actions or inactions of any third party to whom you grant permissions to use your PayPal account or access our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, or any of the PayPal services on your behalf.<\/p>\nLimitation of liability<p>\n<strong>PayPal's liability is limited with respect to your PayPal account and your use of the PayPal services.<\/strong>

PayPal User Agreement PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT About Your Account <p>This user agreement will be effective for all users as of September 14, 2020.\n<\/p> Welcome to PayPal!<p>These are the terms and conditions of the contract between you and PayPal (Europe) S.a r.l.\net Cie, S.C.A.\n(“PayPal”) governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services, which we call our user agreement.\nIt applies only to PayPal accounts of residents of Netherlands.\nIf you are an individual, you must be at least 18 years old and have full legal capacity to enter into a contract to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be registered in Netherlands.<\/p>\n<p>To use the PayPal services you need to open a PayPal account.\nBy opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nYou also agree to comply with the following additional documents and each of the other documents on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees page<\/li>\n<li>Privacy Statement<\/li>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>All future changes notified in the Policy Update already published on the “Legal Agreements” page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement and each of the other documents that apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may revise this user agreement and any of the documents listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide notice to you of at least two months.\nBy continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement take effect, you agree to be bound by those changes.\nIf you do not agree with any changes, you may close your account before the changes take effect.<\/p> Information about us and our service<p>PayPal’s main business is the issuance of electronic money and the provision of payment services using that electronic money.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about us and our service, you can read our Key Payment and Service Information.<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement, together with other legal terms and legally required disclosures relating to your use of our service will be made available to you at all times on the PayPal website (typically located on the “Legal Agreements” page).\nWe may also send this information to you.<\/p>\n<p>You may request a copy of any legally required disclosures (including this user agreement and the Key Payment and Service Information) from us and we will provide this to you in a form which allows you to store and reproduce the information (for example, by e-mail).\n<\/p> Opening an account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.<\/p>Personal accounts<p>With a personal account you can send and request money from friends and family and pay online for purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Holders of certain existing personal accounts may be required to upgrade their accounts (which may include providing further information to PayPal) in order to be able to use all of the current functionality available in a personal account.\n<\/p>\n<p>To use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you must open a business account or convert your personal account to a business account.<\/p>Business accounts <p>Business accounts are for people and organisations (whether incorporated or not) that primarily use PayPal to receive online payments for sales or donations.<\/p>\n<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.\nSee our Fees for further details.<\/p>\n<strong>\n<p>By opening a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\n<\/p>\n<\/strong> Commercial Entity Status <p>If the activity through your business account reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to Commercial Entity Agreements directly with our processing partners to allow you to continue accepting card-funded payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf in addition to this user agreement.\n<\/p> Safe use of your PayPal account <p>You should take reasonable steps to stop your PayPal account being misused.\nYou must maintain adequate security and control of any and all devices, items, IDs, passwords and personal identification numbers / codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nPlease see our Key Payment and Service Information for guidelines.\n<\/p>\n<p>You must comply with all reasonable instructions we may issue regarding how you can keep your Payment Instrument safe.<\/p>\n<p>We may require you to authenticate any instruction relating to your account (i.e.\ngive us the information that we need to be sure that it’s you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information – this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your instruction.<\/p>\n<p>You must keep your postal address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p>\n<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.\nIn some cases you can do this when logged into your account – in other cases you can do this directly with the third party.\nYou acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your Account to this third party.<\/p>\n<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;<\/li>\n<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.\nYou are liable to us for the actions that you authorise the third parties to carry out.\nYou will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>\n<strong>You can close your account at any time.<\/strong> See the PayPal Help Centre for how to do this.<\/p>\n<p>We may close your account at our convenience by providing you with two months’ prior notice.\nWe may also close your account at any time if:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>you are in breach of this user agreement and/or we are otherwise entitled to close your account under this user agreement;<\/li>\n<li>you do not access your account for three years.\nor<\/li>\n<li>we suspect that your account has been accessed without your authorisation.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Where we decide to close your account we will provide you with notice of account closure and where practicable, the reasons for closing your account, together with the ability to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.<\/p>\n<p>When your account is closed:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>this user agreement terminates immediately, except that this user agreement survives termination to the extent and for so long as we require to deal with the closure of your account and to comply with applicable laws and regulations;<\/li>\n<li>we may cancel any pending transactions and you will forfeit any balances associated with special funding arrangements;<\/li>\n<li>we may suspend, limit or terminate your access to or use of our services, websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the services;<\/li>\n<li>you will remain liable for all outstanding obligations under this user agreement related to your account prior to closure;<\/li>\n<li>we may keep your account information in our database for the purpose of fulfilling our legal obligations.\nand<\/li>\n<li>we may retain your electronic money after closure to the extent and for the time we reasonably require to protect us and/or any third party against the risk of reversals, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities of whatever nature.\nAfter this time you will be able to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.\nPlease Contact Us if you have any questions about funds held in your account on closure.<br>\n<strong>If you are the legal representative of an incapacitated or deceased account holder, please Contact Us for assistance.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the event that we decide to discontinue any of our services or any portion or feature of our services for any reason, we will give you at least two months prior notice before discontinuing the service or feature, unless we determine in good faith that: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the service or feature must be discontinued sooner as required by law or a third-party relationship.\nor <\/li>\n<li>doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Linking and Unlinking a Funding Source <p>All money in your account is legally termed “electronic money”, which is recognised throughout the European Economic Area as a form of money suitable for use online.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can use a funding source as a way to pay us to obtain electronic money in your account or to receive withdrawals from your account, as further outlined in this user agreement (see in particular Adding or Withdrawing Money and Funding your Payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card, a prepaid card (where available) a bank account or PayPal Credit (where available) to your PayPal account as a funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may limit the availability of your funding sources to manage our risk.<\/p>\n<p>Please keep your funding source information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third-party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may contact your issuer to request this or remove your funding source from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your funding source, we will keep any preference setting attached to that funding source.\nYou may choose to confirm your card or bank account, so that we can verify that the card or bank account is valid and that you are its owner.\nWe may allow you to do this by following the Link and Confirm Card process (for cards) or the Bank Confirmation process (for bank accounts) or other processes which we may notify to you or which we may publish from time to time.<\/p>Your continuous permission for us to charge your funding sources <p>By linking a funding source to your PayPal account, you give us continuous permission to automatically charge that funding source (subject to this user agreement and the terms of any mandate (e.g.\nbank direct debit) used by the provider of that funding source to set up and maintain that authority) for the required value of the electronic money:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>to cover the payment amount (plus all transaction fees payable to us) when you use your account to send a payment to another user.\nand<\/li>\n<li>to top up your account when you use the Add Funds functionality account interface.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may charge the funding source again if the previous attempt failed.\nIf you cancel any continuous permission from your funding source, you will reimburse us for the value of any electronic money we’ve already issued for which a charge from that funding source remains outstanding.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can stop the permission by unlinking the funding source from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>SEPA is an initiative of the European Commission and European banking sector, aimed at making transactions more efficient within the European Union.\nWhenever you register a bank account with PayPal or use a new bank account for the first time as a Funding Source, you grant PayPal a SEPA Direct Debit mandate.\nIf you use a SEPA Direct Debit mandate for the continuous authority:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can access the mandate and the mandate reference number (MRN) in your PayPal account profile at any time and cancel or change the mandate for future transactions.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal will inform you of the amount of the SEPA Direct Debit payment and the time frame in which PayPal will collect the amount from the bank account together with the purchase confirmation.\nIf PayPal resubmits any SEPA Direct Debit payment request due to reversal of the original payment, there will be no (additional) information given on the amount and the time frame ahead of the resubmission.<\/li>\n<li>you can claim a refund from your bank at any time up to 8 weeks after the date on which the SEPA Direct Debit payment took place in accordance with your bank’s terms and conditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Risk of reversals to your funding source and when eCheques may arise <p>When we receive a payment from your funding source we may store the resulting electronic money in your reserve account for as long as we have reason to believe that there is risk of reversal by the funding source provider.\nThis is because we do not have all the information necessary to place the funds from your payment at your disposal in your PayPal balance while there is such a risk of reversal.\n<\/p>\n<p>When you instruct us to make a payment from your account to another user funded by a payment from your bank account and we store the resulting electronic money in this way, we call this type of payment from your bank account an “eCheque” payment.\nSee Funding payments you send from your account below for how we use eCheques.<\/p> Holding and using a PayPal balance <p>You will not receive interest or any other earnings on the money in your account.\nThis is because the money in your account is electronic money and European law forbids paying interest on electronic money.\nAlso, electronic money is not a deposit or an investment under Luxembourg law, so the Luxembourg deposit guarantee or investor indemnity schemes administered by the <i>Conseil des Protection des Deposants et des Investisseurs<\/i> cannot protect you.<\/p>\n<p>We may store and move the money in your account in and between:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the PayPal balance.\nand <\/li>\n<li>the reserve account, <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>at any given time subject further to this user agreement.<\/p>PayPal balance <p>The operational part of your account contains your PayPal balance, which is the balance of money available for payments or withdrawals.\n<\/p>\n<p>When you use our payment service to pay another user, you instruct us to transfer the money from your PayPal balance to the recipient’s account.\n<\/p>\n<p>You need to have enough PayPal balance in cleared funds to cover the amount of any payment you make and the transaction fees you owe us at the time of the payment.\nOther requirements also apply – see the section Making a Payment below.\nIf you have insufficient PayPal balance or have chosen a preferred funding source you are also requesting us to obtain funds on your behalf from your applicable funding source and issue electronic money to your PayPal balance for your payment to be made.<\/p>\n<p>When you withdraw your money you need to have enough PayPal balance to cover the value of any withdrawal at the time of the withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>See Adding or Withdrawing Money to know how to get a PayPal balance and how to withdraw it.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal balance shows a negative amount, this is the net amount you owe to us at the given time.\n<\/p> Reserve account <p>Money marked in your account overview as “pending”, “uncleared”, “held” or otherwise restricted or limited at any given time is held in the part of your account which acts as a reserve account.\nYou cannot access and use money stored in the reserve account.<\/p> Adding or Withdrawing Money Adding money <p>To get electronic money into your account you can, subject further to this user agreement:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>accept a payment in your account from someone else.\nWe may charge you fees for this.\nor<\/li>\n<li>obtain electronic money from us by paying us an equivalent amount.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can obtain electronic money from us by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>automatically using your applicable funding source(s) to cover the amount of the payments that you instruct us to send to other users (and the transaction fees payable by you to us)..\nor<\/li>\n<li>manually using the “Add Funds” function available from your account interface to pay us or instructing us to charge your funding source for the electronic money.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The execution of any payment to us from your funding source provider is your funding source provider’s legal responsibility.\nWe have no control over how long the payment to us will take.<\/p>Withdrawing money <p>If you have a PayPal balance, you may withdraw any amount by transferring it to your nominated funding source linked to your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nThis could include your bank account or debit or credit card, depending on the country in which your PayPal account is registered.<\/p>\n<p>When you instruct us to withdraw any amount of your PayPal balance, subject further to this user agreement we will:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>convert the electronic money to money that we can transfer to your nominated funding source.\nand <\/li>\n<li>instruct our own bank to transfer that money to your nominated funding source.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We aim to send the withdrawal payment instruction to our bank by the end of the next Business Day (“Business Day” means a day on which banks in Luxembourg are open to the general public).\nif there are no other delays subject to this user agreement.\nOnce our bank receives our payment instruction, we have no control over how long the payment to you will take to complete.\nAt this point, our bank, your funding source provider and the payment systems that they rely on take over responsibility for getting the money to your nominated funding source and this can affect the time it takes for you to receive your money.\nWe may allow you to withdraw the money by transferring the money to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an eligible bank account (where we make this available) through: <ul>\n<li>a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your account (this withdrawal/redemption functionality is sometimes known as “transfer to bank”).\nor<\/li>\n<li>an Instant Transfer to your bank account linked to your account.\n<br>\n<br> We may allow the above transfers to be made through the debit card attached to that bank account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>your branded MasterCard or Visa card (where we make this available).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Fees apply to withdrawals.\nWe will also disclose to you the fees in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>The funding source (for example, bank account or card) into which you request the withdrawal must be denominated in the original opening currency of your account or another currency that PayPal supports for withdrawals in your country of residence.<\/p>\n<p>You may only withdraw PayPal balance in the opening currency of your account, unless we agree otherwise.\nIn order to withdraw PayPal balance held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nOur transaction exchange rate will be used.<\/p>\n<p>This means that if you withdraw:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal balance held in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into your original opening currency.\nand<\/li>\n<li>to a funding source (for example, bank account or card) denominated in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into the currency in which the funding source is denominated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To protect you, our other users and us from loss and to allow us to comply with our anti-money laundering and other legal obligations, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorised the withdrawal or if payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview) to lift your withdrawal limit.<\/p> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies <p>When you open your account, it is configured for use with the opening currency of your account.\n<\/p>\n<p>The opening currency of your account is Euro (EUR).\n<\/p>\n<p>We may configure your account further so that you can use it to store money and send and receive payments in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nIf you hold a PayPal balance, we may allow you to convert it to balance in another currency.\n<\/p>\n<p> If your PayPal balance is not enough to cover the amount of a payment you instruct us to make in a particular currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall.\nThere may be some restrictions on where you can send payments in certain currencies.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may allow you to choose the way in which your account treats and/or converts payments received in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.\nTo receive money in a currency other than the opening currency of your account, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n<\/p>\n<p> Payments in certain currencies can only be received by automatic conversion of the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you receive a payment from anyone who doesn’t have a PayPal account and that payment is in a currency which your account is not currently configured to use, we may automatically convert the amount received into a currency that your account is configured to use at the time the payment is made.\n<\/p>\n<p> Please see the Withdrawing Money section above to see how withdrawals in different currencies can be made.\n<\/p>\n<p> If one of the currency balances in your account shows that you owe us an amount of funds for any reason, we may set off the amount you owe us by using funds you maintain in a different currency balance or by deducting amounts you owe us from money you receive into your account, or money you attempt to withdraw or send from your account, or in a different account, and by deducting funds from any withdrawals you attempt to make.\nIf, for a period of 21 Days, you have a PayPal balance that reflects an amount owing to us that is not in Euros, we may convert the amount you owe us to Euros.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.\nYou are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that we determine is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nWe may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.\n<\/p>How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\n<\/p>\n<p> The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).\n<\/p>\n<p> We may make a transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) available for your review during your transaction.\nIf you complete the transaction, that transaction exchange rate may apply to the payment for the transaction whenever it is processed.\nor that rate may be valid only if the payment for that transaction is processed within a limited time, as stated during the transaction.\nAfter that limited time, we may use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the transaction is processed, or not perform the currency conversion.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you have authorised a payment under a billing agreement, and we perform currency conversion for that payment, we will use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the payment transaction is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment under a billing agreement may vary.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may provide you access to a “Currency Converter” tool to see what transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) may apply for certain currency conversions.\nAny rates shown using the Currency Converter tool only apply at the time you use the tool and are subject to change.<\/p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorise us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\n<\/p>\n<p> You may have the right to have your card issuer convert the currency of the card payment into the currency in which you send the payment from your PayPal account, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether we or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.\n<\/p>\n<p> PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use existing balance or your linked bank account is the funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p> If PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup funding source to be chosen, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on the payment from your backup funding source.\n<\/p>\n<p> Where a currency conversion is offered at the point of sale by the merchant, not by PayPal, and you choose to authorise the payment transaction on the basis of the merchant's exchange rate and charges, PayPal has no liability to you for that currency conversion.\n<\/p> Account Statements and Requesting Account Records <p>Unless your Account is restricted you may view and download your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nYou agree to review your transactions through your PayPal account history instead of receiving periodic statements by email.\n<\/p>\n<p>Key information relating to your payments will be provided to you via e-mail and your transaction history will also be updated and made available to you at any time by logging into your account.\nYou can also access a downloadable report from your PayPal account.\nThis will show all fees incurred and any other amounts charged to your PayPal account in the relevant period.\nThe report will only be updated and made available if there has been any activity on your PayPal account or any fees have been incurred in the relevant period.\nThe way in which we provide the transaction information will allow you to store and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy.\n<\/p>\n<p> We reserve the right to charge a fee for providing you with additional information or for providing the transaction history and other information about fees in a different way but we won’t charge you for records requested in connection with your good-faith assertion of an error in your PayPal account.<\/p> Fees <p> We charge fees for our services as set out on the fees page.\n<\/p>\n<p> Quoted fees are inclusive of all applicable taxes.\nhowever, other taxes or costs may exist that are not paid through or imposed by us.\n<\/p>\n<p> You are liable for telephone charges and any charges made by your internet service provider or similar or associated charges as a result of the use by you of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may deduct our fees from your PayPal balance.\nWe may deduct our transaction-related fees from the amounts we transfer before those funds are credited to your PayPal balance.\n<\/p>\n<p> We will provide you with the details of the amounts you receive and our fees charged either by e-mail or in your transaction history (which you can access by logging into your account).\n<\/p>\n<p> If your payment requires you to pay a fee to us, we may disclose that fee to you when you provide your payment instruction to us.\n<\/p>\n<p> You cannot set off or deduct any amounts from our fees.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may make a charge for any additional services we provide outside this user agreement.\nWe will tell you of those charges when you ask for the service.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a merchant and you wish to apply for (and retain) our volume-based tiered merchant rate, the terms of the merchant rate in the Receiving Payments section below apply.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nMaking A Payment General provisions for making a payment Your payment instruction <p>We may allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in any way which we may notify to you from time to time.\nThe way in which you provide your payment instruction can depend on the type of payment you are making – for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are paying for a purchase or making a donation, many sellers and/or fund collectors allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in a dedicated PayPal checkout or other PayPal payment collection integration on their site.<\/li>\n<li>You can use the “Send Money” feature when you log into your PayPal account to send a payment to someone.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> We may require you to authenticate your instruction (i.e.\ngive us the information that we need to be sure that it’s you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information – this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your payment instruction.\n<\/p> Cancelling your payment instruction <p> Once you provide you payment instruction to us, you may not cancel it, except if it is a payment instruction under a billing agreement (see below for more details).\n<\/p> How long will my payment take? <p>Your payment to another user will leave your account [within the Business Day] after we receive your complete payment instruction.<\/p>\n<p>The payment will leave your account within two Business Days if we receive your complete payment instruction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>on a day which is not a Business Day.\nor<\/li>\n<li>after the following local cut off times on a Business Day for accounts registered in the following countries: 4pm in Netherlands.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may allow you to ask us to make your payment on a specific later date, in which case your payment will leave your account on that later date.<\/p>\n<p>Other provisions in this user agreement may cause the above timeframes to be extended.<\/p>When we may refuse to make your payment <p>We may treat your payment instruction as not complete and we may refuse to make your payment if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you do not have enough money in your PayPal balance.\n<\/li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that your linked funding sources do not have sufficient funds to cover the money required to make your payment;<\/li>\n<li>you do not provide us with all mandatory information requested in the relevant payment or checkout flows which we use to obtain your payment instructions (for instance, sufficient details of the recipient as we may request and authentication of your payment instruction);<\/li>\n<li>the payment exceeds the sending limit we tell you about when you try to make the payment.\nor<\/li>\n<li>we have reason to believe that a restricted activity has happened in relation to your account or you are otherwise in breach of this user agreement.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> When your payment is not accepted by the recipient <p> If we allow you to send a payment to someone who does not have a PayPal account, the recipient can claim the money by opening a PayPal account.\n<\/p>\n<p> If the recipient already has a PayPal account, they can refuse to accept the money.\n<\/p>\n<p> If the recipient refuses to accept the money or doesn’t open a PayPal account and claim the money within 30 days after the date it is sent, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to your PayPal account.\nSee Refunds to your account for what can happen when your PayPal account receives a refund.\n<\/p> Sending limits <p> We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can make, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nTo lift your sending limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).<\/p> Setting up automatic charges from your account Seller delayed payments <p> When you pay certain sellers or pay for certain purchases (for instance, purchases which have to be shipped to you or may be updated and finalised by the seller), you are providing: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an authorisation to the seller to collect your payment at a later time.\nand<\/li>\n<li>an instruction to us to automatically pay that seller when the seller requests payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> Your authorisation will typically remain valid for up to 30 days, but may remain valid for longer.\nIf you have balance, we may hold the payment amount as pending until the seller collects your payment.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied (as described in the Currency Conversion section) at the time the payment is processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> Your authorisation allows the seller to update the payment amount before the seller collects the payment (to account for any changes to the purchase that you may agree with the seller, such as additional taxes, shipping or postage charges or discounts).\nWe are not required to verify any changes at any time (including at the time the payment is transferred).\nWe may transfer any amount on the basis of your authorisation and upon receiving instructions from the seller of the final payment amount.\n<\/p> Billing agreement payments <p> You can use a billing agreement to manage payments to the same recipient(s) on an ongoing automatic basis.\nWhen you enter into a billing agreement:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>you authorise the named recipient(s) to collect payments from your account as the recipient determines (this could be for payments of amounts you owe the recipient for a purchase of goods or services under a separate contract that you have with the recipient).\nand<\/li>\n<li>you instruct PayPal to pay the named recipient(s) (or other recipient(s) that the named recipient(s) direct(s)) when the named recipient(s) request(s) PayPal to make your payment.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This makes the recipient a “trusted beneficiary” (the legal term for someone you tell us is a trusted recipient) of all your payments made under that billing agreement, so we will not normally ask you to authenticate (e.g.\nlog in) or approve these payments when they are made.\n<\/p>\n<p> Payments made under the billing agreement may be in variable amounts and may be made on various dates.\nWe are only a payment service provider so we can’t (and please don’t expect us to) know what you have or haven’t agreed with the recipient or to know why the recipient decided to collect your payment.\nWe are not obliged to verify or confirm the amount the recipient presents to us for the purpose of processing payments made under the billing agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> We use several names for payments that can be managed by a billing agreement – these include “automatic payments,” \"subscription payments\" \"recurring payments” “reference transactions” \"preauthorised transfers\" or \"preapproved payment.\" <\/p>\n<p> You can cancel your billing agreement at any time with immediate effect in your account interface or by contacting us.\nWhere a payment under that billing agreement is scheduled to be made before the end of the next Business Day after you tell us to cancel it, we may cancel your billing agreement after that payment has been made.\nIf you cancel a billing agreement, you may still owe the recipient money for goods or services that you have received but have not paid for.\n<\/p>\n<p> If we determine currency conversion is necessary for a billing agreement payment, and we perform the conversion, we will use the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the payment is processed.\nThe transaction exchange rate for each payment transaction may vary.\n<\/p> Refunds to your account How refunds can happen <p> We may allow the recipient of your payment to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>refuse to accept it.\nor<\/li>\n<li>decide to accept it and then use our service to send you a refund of all or any part of the amount of the payment later.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> We will return the amount of any refused payment or refunded payment to your Balance.\nWe will return the amount of an unclaimed payment to your balance within 30 days after the date you initiated the payment.\nIf any amount of any payment is returned to you in any of the ways outlined above, we may convert the returned amount for you into either: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the currency of the balance you used for the original payment (before any conversion into the currency received by the recipient happened);<\/li>\n<li>the opening currency of your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>US dollars (opening a balance in that currency for you, if you don’t have one already).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the original payment you sent involved a currency conversion we will convert the returned amount from the currency received by the recipient as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the amount is returned within 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable on the date of the original payment, so that you receive the original amount (including the currency conversion fee you paid) in the original currency you converted for the original payment.\nand<\/li>\n<li>if the amount is returned after 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of the conversion of the returned amount.\nYou agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Unless otherwise outlined above in this section, you agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments when you convert any amount returned to you in the ways outlined above.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may also automatically withdraw the returned amount from your Balance and transfer the funds back to the funding source you used for the original payment.\nWithdrawals can also involve a currency conversion – see the section on Withdrawing money above.\n<\/p>Risks when receiving refunds <p> The returned amount could be lower in value than your original payment amount.\nThis can happen as a result of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the recipient sending you a refund lower in value than your original payment amount.\nAs we are only a payment service provider, we cannot know what you are entitled to from the original payment recipient as a refund or why the recipient sent the refund in a particular amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>transaction exchange rate fluctuations.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal is not responsible for any loss resulting from the recipient's decision to refuse or refund your payment, except to the extent that a refund sent by the recipient is a payment executed incorrectly by PayPal <\/p>\n<p>We are not liable to you for the difference between the value of your original payment and the value of the resulting refund, except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).\n<\/p> Funding Your Payment Selecting a preferred funding source <p>You may select a preferred funding source when logged into your account.\nSubject to this user agreement, the preferred funding source will be used as the default funding source for payments you send from your account.<\/p>\n<p> You can set separate preferred funding sources for some billing agreement payments.\n<\/p> Special Funding Arrangements <p> Some payments can be funded by special funding arrangements linked to your PayPal account, such as merchant/transaction specific balance, gift vouchers or other promotional funding arrangements.\nThe use and priority of these special funding arrangements are subject to further terms and conditions between you and us.\nYour account overview may show the notional amount available in your special funding arrangements to fund qualifying payments at any given time.\nThis amount does not constitute electronic money, is not deemed part of your PayPal balance and is not redeemable in cash - it only represents the amount of electronic money which we offer to issue and credit to your account at the time of (and only to immediately fund) a qualifying payment, subject to (and only for the period outlined in) the further terms and conditions of use of that special funding arrangement.\nIf your payment funded by a special funding arrangement is reversed at a later time for any reason, we will keep the amount that represents the portion of that payment that was funded by your special funding arrangement and (provided that the special funding arrangement has not already expired) reinstate the special funding arrangement.<\/p> Funding payments you send from your account <p> We will obtain electronic money for the payment you send from your account from the following sources in the following order to the extent they are available:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Special Funding Arrangements (if available for the given transaction)<\/li>\n<li>Preferred funding source (if selected and available)<\/li>\n<li>Pre-existing PayPal balance<\/li>\n<li>Bank account (instant transfer via bank mandate)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal Credit (where available)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal-branded debit card (where available)<\/li>\n<li>PayPal-branded credit card (where available)<\/li>\n<li>Debit card<\/li>\n<li>Credit card<\/li>\n<li>Bank account (eCheque) <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you have linked a bank account as a funding source we may choose to offer you access to Pay After Delivery, which allows you to defer a charge to this bank account for a period of time.\nIf you are offered and choose to use this service, the Pay After Delivery Terms will apply.<\/p> PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection.\nWhen applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection.\nPayPal’s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn’t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn’t what you ordered (referred to as a “Significantly Not as Described” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the PayPal Buyer Protection, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.<\/p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection.<\/p>Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>\n<strong>will not<\/strong>\n<\/em> qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not Received claim, if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller’s retail point of sale, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions or<\/li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller’s description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as “new” but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn’t receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as “used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal Buyer Protection <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats, except for personally portable light vehicles used for recreational purposes like bicycles and wheeled hoverboards.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms, as well as payments made on crowdlending platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller’s retail point of sale, , except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Payments to state-run bodies, (except for state-owned enterprises) or traders acting on mandates received from state-run bodies.<\/li>\n<li>Payment equivalent to cash, including stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal Payments.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay&nbsp.\ni.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made in respect of gold (whether in physical form or in exchange-traded form).<\/li>\n<\/ul> Transaction eligibility for PayPal Buyer Protection <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, then follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery related to such purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you’re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the&nbsp;<strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>&nbsp;to pursue a claim under our PayPal Buyer Protection.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within&nbsp;180 days&nbsp;of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal&nbsp;account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days&nbsp;after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nIf you are making an Item Not Received claim, PayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.<\/p>\n<p>Step 3:&nbsp;<strong>Respond to PayPal’s requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4:&nbsp;<strong>Comply with PayPal’s shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you’re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item&nbsp;back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide Proof of Delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Step 5:&nbsp;<strong>PayPal will make a final decision&nbsp;<\/strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p> Event tickets <p>In certain cases, if you purchase a ticket or pay for the right to attend an event from a payment recipient who is a UK registered PayPal account holder (“Event”), all monies paid by you may be held by PayPal on trust for you, so that the beneficial interest in such monies remains with you until the performance of the Event in question.<\/p>Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal’s Buyer Protection.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don’t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our PayPal Buyer Protection, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can’t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we’ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won’t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).<\/p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller’s return policy.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nReceiving Payments General provisions for receiving payments <p>PayPal may allow anybody (with or without an account) to make a payment resulting in the issuance or transfer of electronic money to your account.\n<\/p>\n<p>By integrating (including by having already integrated) into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>The receipt of a payment into your account does not equate to the receipt of cleared funds.\nA notification that a payment has been sent to you does not amount to a receipt of electronic money in your account unless you have accepted the payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may allow you to accept payments in any currency supported by our Service from time to time.\n<\/p>\n<p>Where you (instead of PayPal) offer the payer at the point of sale a currency conversion of an amount you receive through PayPal, you will inform the buyer of the exchange rate and any charges that will be applied to the payment transaction.\nPayPal has no liability to any buyer if you fail to inform the buyer of the exchange rate and charges.\nYou acknowledge that if you fail to disclose the exchange rate and charges to the buyer this may constitute a criminal offence by you.<\/p>\n<p>Any payment sent to you may be subject to a reversal, payment review, limitation, reserve or hold as allowed under this user agreement.\n<\/p>Receiving limits <p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can receive, including money you receive for purchases.\nTo lift your receiving limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).<\/p>\n<strong>New checkout solution included in the PayPal Commerce Platform<\/strong>\n<p>The PayPal Commerce Platform includes our new checkout solution.&nbsp.\nThe checkout solution consists of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>our dedicated bundled checkout capability in your online checkout/platform to enable a buyer with or without an account to send a payment to your account.\nand<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fraud Protection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may offer you all, any part or any combination of parts of the checkout solution.\nIf we offer you the checkout solution and you choose to use it, in addition to this user agreement, you agree to the following further terms relating to the following capabilities:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement<\/strong>, when you use our APM functionality as part of the checkout solution.\nand<\/li>\n<li>the&nbsp;<strong>PayPal Online Card Payment Services Agreement<\/strong>, when you use: <ul>\n<li>our Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments as part of the checkout solution bundle.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Fraud Protection as part of the checkout solution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Our <strong>Fees<\/strong>&nbsp;for using the checkout solution apply.<\/p> Rules about surcharging <p>PayPal does not encourage surcharging because it is a commercial practice that can penalise the consumer and create unnecessary confusion, friction and abandonment at checkout.\n<\/p>\n<p>You may only surcharge for the use of our services in compliance with any law applicable to you and not in excess of the surcharges that you apply for the use of other payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>If you surcharge a buyer, you, and not we, will inform the buyer of the requested charge.\nWe are not liable to any buyer where you have failed to inform the buyer of any surcharge.\nYou acknowledge that you could be committing a criminal offence if you surcharge and/or fail to disclose any form of surcharge to a buyer.<\/p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal as a payment method or mark at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or substantially similar:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>logo placement,<\/li>\n<li>position within any point of sale,<\/li>\n<li>treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, or fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterise PayPal as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal.<\/p> Taxes and information reporting <p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nWe are not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.\nAs a bank service provider no sales tax applies to the PayPal services in the EU.<\/p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy.<\/p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace’s or the third party application’s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p>\n<p>We may allow you to authorise certain marketplaces to use your account to pay amounts you owe to the marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) arising from a claim under the terms of the marketplace’s own resolution process (“<strong>Marketplace Due Amounts<\/strong>”).\nIf you give such an authorisation and the marketplace notifies us of the claim, you instruct us to process payments of all and any Marketplace Due Amounts relating to that claim from your PayPal account to that marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) according to the marketplace’s instructions to us.\nWe may treat your instruction for the payment of any given Marketplace Due Amount as cancelled if we decide that the claim would have been determined in your favour had it been filed as a claim with us.\nYou can also cancel this instruction by contacting us.\nAll claims filed directly with the marketplace are governed by the marketplace’s own policy only.\nThe terms of the PayPal Seller Protection Programme do not cover you for claims filed by your buyers directly with the marketplace.<\/p> Accepting billing agreement payments <p>If we allow you to accept payments from a payer under a billing agreement, when you present to us a payment request under that billing agreement, you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>warrant to us that the amounts you present have been agreed and consented to by the payer whose account will be deducted (including changes to those amounts) and that you will give prior notice of the deduction to the payer.\nand<\/li>\n<li>agree that you will notify the payer at least 4 weeks in advance of the amount they will collect if that amount has increased in such a manner that the payer could not have reasonably expected to pay such an amount, taking into account the payer’s previous spending patterns and the circumstances of the payment and that you are liable to us for any refunds of that payment in accordance with the terms of this user agreement.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Refunds and reversals of payments <p>When you receive a payment, it could be refunded or reversed.\nWe may allow you to send to the payer a refund of the payment.\nWe may carry out a reversal of your payment in certain circumstances.\nSee the rest of this section for more details.<\/p>Refunds <p>You alone are (and PayPal is not) responsible for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>your legal and contractual obligations towards the payer for any amount you return to the payer.\nand<\/li>\n<li>any difference between the cost to the payer of making the original payment and the value of the amount returned to the payer (for instance, as a result of transaction exchange rate fluctuations) except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).<br>\n<br>See our fees for details of the fees you paid to us as the recipient of the original payment which we retain when you use the special commercial transaction refund functionality in your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.\nexcept to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).<\/li>\n<\/ul>Reversals <p>If you receive a payment in your account, you owe us the full amount of the payment and our losses arising from processing the payment.\nThis can include our liability (including any fees, charges and penalties) towards any third party (including the payer and the payer’s funding source provider).<\/p>\n<p>A reversal happens when we exercise our right to set off the above amounts from your account under the section Reimbursement for your liability in this user agreement.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount you owe us in that currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall and you will be charged for the currency conversion.\nThis means that, for example, if you are a seller, amounts of payments received in your account may be removed from your account after you have delivered any goods or services sold.<\/p>\n<p>A reversal can happen when:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we reimburse the payer in respect of a PayPal Buyer Protection claim the payer made against you.<\/li>\n<li>we compensate the payer or the payer’s funding source provider (or both) because we receive a claim from the payer or their funding source provider for the payment amount under the reversal process used by that funding source provider.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For instance:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the payer used a card to fund the payment to you the payer could pursue a “chargeback” with the card issuer.\nThe card issuer, not us, determines whether the payer is successful when they pursue a chargeback.\nYou can find out more about chargebacks by reviewing our Chargeback Guide, accessible via the PayPal Security Centre and the section called: “Selling Safely”.\nThe PayPal Security Centre is accessed via the PayPal website.\nWe charge you a fee for receiving a chargeback claim.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If the payer used a bank account to fund the payment the payer or the bank could pursue a bank reversal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The amount claimed may be greater than the original amount you received due to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the time of payment and the time of the claim.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>we may have to compensate your payer when they claimed that there was a problem with their payment (including that their payment was unauthorised or incorrect or that their billing agreement payment was not expected) – see Resolving Problems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>we are entitled to carry out the reversal for any other reason under this user agreement, including the provision Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Impact of PayPal Buyer Protection on sellers <p> You should read our Buyer Protection Policy and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection made available by PayPal to buyers in each of those countries as buyers’ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about the PayPal Buyer Protection on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer’s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding PayPal Buyer Protection listed on that page or in the corresponding user agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under&nbsp;PayPal Buyer Protection&nbsp.\nin any country:<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back plus pay for return shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/p>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay’s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your cash account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nplace a&nbsp;hold&nbsp;on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor<\/p>\n<p>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/p> PayPal Seller Protection What’s eligible <p>If you have received more than €100,000 per month at least once over a consecutive period of 6 months on your PayPal Account and/or if you are applying surcharge for the use of PayPal (when the law applicable to you allows you to apply surcharge), you are not eligible for PayPal seller protection and this section applies to you unless otherwise agreed between you and PayPal.\nPayPal will review your eligibility for seller protection in October and April of each calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks,&nbsp;you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Seller Protection.\nWhen it applies, PayPal Seller Protection entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program<\/p>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an “Unauthorized Transaction” claim) and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They didn’t receive the item from you (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal Seller Protection may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal Seller Protection as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various PayPal Buyer protection processes on sellers.<\/p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the Netherlands.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for items subject to the&nbsp;<strong>Intangible Goods Additional Requirements<\/strong>.\nTransactions involving items that you deliver in person in connection with payment made in your physical store, may also be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection so long as the buyer paid for the transaction in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person, provided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the&nbsp;<strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.&nbsp;If you do not respond to PayPal’s request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>Provide proof of shipment or delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The payment must be marked \"eligible\" or \"partially eligible\" in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims for PayPal Seller Protection on the \"Transaction Details\" page.<\/li>\n<li>You must accept a single payment from one PayPal Account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Seller Protection program.\nPayPal will make a decision, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements, any information or documentation provided during the resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>Item Not Received additional requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection program for a buyer’s Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements&nbsp.\nlisted above and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked “eligible” for PayPal’s Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements<\/li>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third party or if you have a native app integration.<\/li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.<\/li>\n<li>If the transaction is a payment for digital goods or licenses for digital content, you must have paid Standard Transaction Fees on the sale (this does not apply to payments for other Intangible Goods).<\/li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of delivery for Intangible Goods.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as:<\/p>\n<p>Proof of shipment<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery<\/p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the Transaction Details page, or<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing

(based on the currency of the payment) listed in the&nbsp;<strong>signature confirmation threshold table<\/strong>.\nSignature confirmation is online documentation, viewable at the shipping company’s website, indicating that the item was signed for.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> Your choice of carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.\nPlease ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide ‘delivered’ status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of delivery for intangible goods:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>QR Code Transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of shipment or proof of delivery:<\/p>\n<p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.\nCompelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Received or accessed by the recipient<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For QR code transactions you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information to the

generally.<\/p> Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities <p>If we believe that you’ve engaged in any of these activities, we may take a number of actions to protect PayPal, its customers and others at any time in our sole discretion.&nbsp.\nThe actions we may take include, but are not limited to, the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terminate this user agreement, limit your account, and/or close or suspend your account, immediately and without penalty to us;<\/li>\n<li>Refuse to provide the PayPal services to you in the future;<\/li>\n<li>At any time and without

money or make withdrawals;<\/li>\n<li>Hold your money to the extent and for so long as reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability.\nYou acknowledge that, as a non-exhaustive guide:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>PayPal’s risk of liability in respect of card-funded payments that you receive can last until the risk of a chargeback closing in favour of the payer/buyer (as determined by card scheme rules) has passed.\nThis depends on certain factors, including, without limitation: <ul>\n<li>a.\nThe type of goods or services for which you receive payment.\nor<\/li>\n<li>b.\nThe timeframe for delivery of the goods or performance of the services for which you receive payment (e.g.\nsales of event tickets months in advance of the event date can present a higher and more enduring risk of chargebacks than sales of most other items or services);<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>PayPal’s risk of liability in respect of a claim or dispute arising from a payment that you receive can last for the time that it takes for the parties to close the claim or dispute and all appeals associated with that claim or dispute in accordance with PayPal Buyer Protection<\/li>\n<li>PayPal’s risk of liability in respect of any event of insolvency that you suffer can last for as long as and to the extent that laws applicable to your insolvency restrict PayPal from taking legal action against you.\nand<\/li>\n<li>If you allow your PayPal account to have a balance reflecting an amount owing to PayPal, PayPal’s risk of liability can last for the time and to the extent that you owe that amount to PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Block your PayPal account and/or hold any funds in the reserve account (including, without limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by PayPal, where PayPal’s rights arise from your engagement in the restricted activity);<\/li>\n<li>Refuse any particular payment transaction at any time for any reason and will only be

violation of this policy,<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account primarily for the purposes of your trade, business, craft or profession and you violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal's damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>you acknowledge and agree that USD 2,500.00 (or the prevailing equivalent in the currency of the country in which you reside) per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is: <ul>\n<li>a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated;<\/li>\n<li>reasonable and proportionate in its application to the provision of the Services to you.\nand<\/li>\n<li>necessary, but no more than sufficient, to protect PayPal’s legitimate interest in your compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy.\nand<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please also see the section below on <u>Your liability<\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>Unless otherwise directed by us, you must not use or attempt to use your account while it is suspended or has been closed.\nYou must ensure that all agreements with sellers or other third parties that involve third party initiated payments (including billing agreement payments) set up from your account are cancelled immediately upon the termination, suspension or closure of your account.\nYou remain liable under this user agreement in respect of all charges and other amounts incurred through the use of your account at any time, irrespective of termination, suspension or closure.<\/p> Holds, Limitations, and Reserves What are holds, limitations and reserves? <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nIf we take any of the actions described here, we will normally notify you of our actions, but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example if you are in breach of this user agreement or we consider it advisable for security reasons), take any of these actions without prior notice to you.<\/p>\n<p>To request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that any funds held under this user agreement may be placed in your reserve account and that you will provide to us any information as we may reasonably request to allow us to determine whether the risk has passed.<\/p>Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.&nbsp.\nWhen PayPal places a hold on a payment amount, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\n&nbsp;PayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include where we have reason to believe that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transactions are higher risk, this can be where the transaction involves the sale of goods or services in a high risk category, or other facts known to us typically resulting in an increased number of chargebacks, other claims or disputes or to be often involved in fraud or illegal activity;<\/li>\n<li>There is a sudden and abnormal change in a PayPal account holder’s selling activity including an increase in the number of chargebacks, reversals, or buyer complaints received in relation to such PayPal account;<\/li>\n<li>Any PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities;<\/li>\n<li>A PayPal account involved in the transaction may have been compromised, or that stolen financial details (bank or credit card) are used for the payment, or otherwise a transaction has not been properly authorised;<\/li>\n<li>A user is trying to send or withdraw funds they received fraudulently;<\/li>\n<li>A user has not provided sufficient Information to us to enable us to verify their identity or the identity of their business and/or the user has a limited trading history with PayPal;<\/li>\n<li>A payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer files a chargeback, reversal or PayPal Buyer Protection claim on a payment you received.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer files a claim under a marketplace's resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of reversal of funds in your account to your funding source.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).<\/li>\n<\/ul>Payment review <p>When we identify a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nThis may be because we have the reasonable suspicion that the payer’s PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities or for other reasons as determined by us in our reasonable discretion.&nbsp.\nThis may include where there is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).<\/p>\n<p>If a payment is subject to payment review, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>execute the payment order initiated by the buyer;<\/li>\n<li>in our discretion, immediately upon such execution restrict the payer’s account;<\/li>\n<li>place a hold on the payment [in the payer’s account].\nand/or<\/li>\n<li>notify the recipient to delay the delivery of the purchase paid for by the payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If we don’t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\n<p>All payments that complete payment review are still subject to being reversed under the terms of this user agreement but will be Seller Protection eligible if they meet the Seller Protection requirements.\nPayPal will provide notices to you by email and/or in the transaction history tab of your PayPal account.\nA payment subject to payment review is a review of the payment only and is implemented to reduce the risk of PayPal users receiving high risk transactions.\nA payment subject to payment review is neither a review nor a representation by PayPal as to the commercial dealings, character or reputation of a party to the payment transaction and should not be considered as a lessening of the respect of any person.<\/p>Holds related to your instructions <p>Certain PayPal functionality may allow you (whether directly or via someone you permit to act on your behalf, like an online marketplace platform on which you transact as a seller) to instruct us to hold your funds (including the proceeds of payments you receive using PayPal) in your reserve account.<\/p>\n<p>In such a case we will show you the availability status of those funds in your balance – the status descriptions may differ according to the functionality you used to instruct us to place the hold.\nWe will release the hold on the funds according to the instruction that you (or the entity that you have permitted to act on your behalf) give to us, subject to the rest of this user agreement.<\/p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice&nbsp;<strong>restricted activities<\/strong>, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.&nbsp.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including where we have reason to believe that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, then we’ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>Someone has used your card or bank account without your permission, for example if your debit or credit card issuer or bank alerts us to this.<\/li>\n<li>You have breached this user agreement or violated the&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>Your performance as a seller indicate your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you’ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<li>There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities&nbsp;above).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may also limit your PayPal account in order to comply with applicable law.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>Reserves <p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.&nbsp.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the funds in your PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A “rolling reserve”<\/strong>&nbsp;is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A “minimum reserve”<\/strong>&nbsp;is a specific minimum amount of funds that you’re required to keep available in your balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your PayPal account, the money will be moved to your reserve account and shown as “pending” and we’ll notify you about it.<\/p>\n<p>If we change the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you about it as well.<\/p>\n<p>You will undertake, at your own expense, any further action required to establish a reserve or other form of security in a manner reasonably determined by us.&nbsp.\nThis can involve executing any necessary documents and registering any form of document reasonably required by us to allow us to perfect any form of security interest.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nRESOLVING PROBLEMS <strong>\n<p>We strongly recommend that you monitor your account closely on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<\/strong> If you find a problem… <p>If you have any reason to believe that there is a problem with your account or our service, follow these steps:<\/p> Step 1: Take a few moments to identify the type of problem: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Unexpected billing agreement payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where you entered into a billing agreement but a payment was sent from your account to another PayPal account under that billing agreement where:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>you didn’t agree with the recipient in advance the exact payment amount.\nand<\/li>\n<li>the payment amount ended up being more than you could reasonably have expected to pay based on previous charges and the other circumstances.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Incorrect payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where a payment sent from your account to another PayPal account was not sent as you specified when you asked us to make it (e.g.\nfor the wrong amount, delayed, wrong recipient) or you received such a payment.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Security / Fraud problem<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Unauthorised payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where a payment sent from your account wasn’t authorised by you (or anyone who’s authorised to make payments for you).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Another type of security / fraud problem<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where there was another security or fraud problem, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>there was some other unauthorised access to your account.<\/li>\n<li>your password or PIN was compromised.<\/li>\n<li>a device you have used to access our services was lost, stolen or deactivated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<br>\n<p>Follow the steps in the section “<strong>What to do in case of a security problem<\/strong>” in the <strong>\n<u>Key Payment and Service Information<\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;as soon as possible before contacting us.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Another type of problem <\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<br>\n<p>This is where there was another type of problem with your account or with our service which is not mentioned above.\nFor instance, we may have made a factual, computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal when you added money to or withdrew money from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If a purchase that you paid for with PayPal was not as described or you have not received the purchase, the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy, not this section, may apply.&nbsp.\nPlease see the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy&nbsp;for how to deal with these particular problems.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Step 2: Tell us about the problem <p>\n<strong>\n<u>Contact us&nbsp;as soon as possible<\/u>\n<\/strong> to tell us about the problem (including the type of problem you are contacting us about so that we can help you as quickly as we can).<\/p>\n<p>You must give us all the information we reasonably request as to the circumstances of the problem and take all reasonable steps we request to assist us in our investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If you tell us about your problem orally, we may require that you report your problem in writing within 10&nbsp;<strong>Business Days<\/strong> after that.<\/p>\n<p>We may provide third parties with information we consider relevant in such circumstances in accordance with our <strong>\n<u>Privacy Policy<\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;(alternatively known as our Privacy Statement).<\/p> How we will help...\n<p>Subject to the rest of this user agreement, we aim to investigate the problem and work with you to resolve it within 60 days.\nIn addition, if your problem is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an unexpected billing agreement payment, <\/u>\n<\/strong>&nbsp;within 10 Business Days after telling us about it we will either: <ul>\n<li>reimburse you for the payment amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>explain why we cannot reimburse you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an incorrect payment to another Paypal account, <\/u>\n<\/strong>we will:<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>make immediate efforts to trace the payment and notify you of the outcome without charge to you;<\/li>\n<li>compensate you as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) by putting your account in the state it would have been in had the incorrect payment been sent as actually specified by the sender.\nThis means: <ul>\n<li>If the incorrect payment resulted in you having less money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we will credit your account for the difference.<\/li>\n<li>If the incorrect payment resulted in you having more money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we may debit the extra funds from your&nbsp;account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>reimburse you in your account for your losses or damages directly and reasonably foreseeably caused by the incorrect payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>an unauthorised payment to another PayPal account, <\/u>\n<\/strong>as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) we will put your account back to where it would have been had the payment never happened.&nbsp.\nThis can include a <u>reimbursement<\/u> of your payment.<\/li>\n<\/ul> When we can’t compensate you...\n<p>You are not entitled to any financial compensation from us as outlined above and you will owe to us (and we may reverse from your account) any compensation you have already received from us if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You do not give us all the information we reasonably requested as to the circumstances of the problem (including, if you tell us about your problem orally, you fail to comply with our request that you tell us about your problem in writing within 10&nbsp;<strong>Business Days<\/strong>);<\/li>\n<li>You do not take all reasonable steps that we request to assist us in our investigation;<\/li>\n<li>We can show that you acted fraudulently;<\/li>\n<li>We can show that circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood or loss of internet connection) caused the problem, despite our reasonable precautions;<\/li>\n<li>We have reason to believe otherwise that there is no problem which entitles you to compensation.\nor<\/li>\n<li>In respect of the following specific problems:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Unexpected billing agreement payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Incorrect payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Unauthorised payment<\/u>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 8 weeks after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>You agreed for us to make your payment and the details were made available to you by us or the merchant at least 4 weeks before the payment was made.<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that you gave us the wrong payment details.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that the payment was sent as the payer specified when the payer asked us to make it.\nor<\/p>\n<p>Through no fault of ours, you did not have enough PayPal balance to complete the payment.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/p>\n<p>A delay which you claimed caused the incorrect payment actually resulted from PayPal applying&nbsp;a <strong>hold, limitation or reserve <\/strong>\n<strong>under this user agreement<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.\nor<\/p>\n<p>We can show that the payment was made because you did not keep your account safe either intentionally or with gross negligence (for instance, you very carelessly chose to share your PayPal ID and/or password/PIN with someone else).\nor<\/p>\n<p>There was <strong>another security /fraud problem<\/strong> and you didn’t tell us about it.\nWe will not pay you compensation for any unauthorised payments made from your account before you told us about that problem.\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes we might spot the problem first.&nbsp.\nIf we need to notify you about the problem, we will ordinarily do so through the Secure Messaging Centre, which you need to log into your account to access.\nIf you should take action urgently, we may also use other means such as email to request action.<\/p>\n<p>If a payment was made from us to your funding source by way of mistake, we may correct the mistake by debiting or crediting (as the case may be) your appropriate funding source(s).<\/p> Complaints Reporting disputes between you and PayPal regarding our services<p>Contact us&nbsp;to report disputes between you and PayPal regarding our services.<\/p>\n<p>If a dispute

agreement will be effective for all users as of October 31, 2020.<\/p> Welcome to PayPal! <p>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal Pte.\nLtd., a Singaporean company governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nIf you are an individual, you must be a resident of one of the countries/regions listed on the <strong>PayPal Worldwide<\/strong> page and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your country/region of residence to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of one of the countries/regions listed on the <strong>PayPal Worldwide<\/strong> page to open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nYou also agree to comply with the following additional policies and each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>Alternative Payment Methods Terms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, the terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.\n<\/p>\n<p>We may amend this user agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it on our website, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you with at least 14 days notice.\nAll future changes set out in the Policy Updates page already published on the Legal Agreements page at the time you register for the PayPal services are incorporated by reference into this user agreement and will take effect as specified in the Policy Update.<\/p>\n<p>If you do not agree to the revised terms and conditions, you must stop using the PayPal services, close your account and terminate your relationship with us without cost or penalty.\nThis user agreement will continue to apply to your previous use of our services.<\/p> About our main business <p>PayPal is a payment services provider and acts as such by creating, hosting, maintaining and providing our PayPal services to you via the internet.\nOur services allow you to send payments to anyone with a PayPal account, and, where available, to receive payments.\nOur service availability varies by country/region.\nYou can see what services are available in your country/region by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>The PayPal services are offered by PayPal Pte.\nLtd.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consumer Advisory — PayPal Pte.\nLtd., the holder of the PayPal stored value facility, does not require the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\nConsumers (users) are advised to read the terms and conditions carefully.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement is not a solicitation of the PayPal services and PayPal is not targeting any country/region or market through this user agreement.<\/p> Opening an Account <p>We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.<\/p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive payments.<\/li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.<\/li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods.<\/li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, PayPal balance, eCheque or other payment methods from others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>In order to open and maintain a PayPal account, you must list your correct country/region of residence and provide us with correct and updated account information, including but not limited to personal information, financial information, or other information related to you or your business.<\/p>\n<p>You must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p> Personal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send payments to family and friends, a personal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal account you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy goods and services.<\/li>\n<li>Send and request payments from friends and family.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>You can also use a personal account to receive payments for the sale of goods and services, but if you plan to use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should consider a business account.\nYou can convert your PayPal account from a personal account to a business account should circumstances change.<\/p> Business accounts <p>We recommend business accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business account, you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening, when you request certain new products and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business account.<\/strong>\n<\/p> Commercial Entity Agreement <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.<\/p> Third Party permissions <p>You must be the beneficial owner of your PayPal account, and conduct business only on behalf of yourself.<\/p>\n<p>You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.\nIn some cases, you can do this when logged into your PayPal account – in other cases, you can do this directly with the third party.\nYou acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your PayPal account to this third party.<\/p>\n<p>You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;<\/li>\n<li>confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Granting permission to any third party to access your PayPal account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.\nYou are liable to us for the actions that you authorize the third parties to carry out.\nYou will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights.<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost or penalty, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nYou must withdraw or transfer any PayPal balance from your PayPal account before closing it.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.\n<\/p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card or a bank account to your PayPal account as a payment method.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (i.e.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.<\/p> Holding a PayPal Balance <p>Any PayPal balance you hold represents an unsecured claim against PayPal.\nPayPal combines your balance with the balances of other users and invests those funds in liquid investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held separate from PayPal's corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.\nYou will not receive interest or other earnings on the amounts in your balance.\nYou agree PayPal shall own the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nYou agree to assign any rights to any interest derived from your funds to PayPal.<\/p> Adding or Withdrawing Funds Adding funds to your balance <p>You may use the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to fund transactions you make using your PayPal account.\nYou don't need a PayPal balance to buy something or send payments.\nYou can add funds your PayPal account from the bank account that's linked to your PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer to your PayPal account.\nThe amount transferred will be held as a balance in your PayPal account.\nCredit cards cannot be used to add funds to your PayPal balance.<\/p> Withdrawing funds from your balance <p>If you have a PayPal balance, log into your PayPal account to see which of these withdrawal options are available in your country/region:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it to a bank account linked to your PayPal account.\nor<\/li>\n<li>transferring it to your debit or credit card, where available.\nor<\/li>\n<li>requesting a physical cheque through the mail, where available.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on the country/region in which your account is registered, you may be able to withdraw your funds through a third party service provider.\nPlease see terms of such third party for information regarding currency conversions.<\/p>\n<p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or the negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit card or debit card information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may charge a fee to make a transfer to your bank account.\nIf your debit card is eligible to receive withdrawals from your PayPal account, you will be provided the option to use it when you transfer funds out of your PayPal balance, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for personal accounts) page and the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business accounts) page.\nThe applicable fees will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, we will send physical cheques through the mail only to confirmed addresses, unless we have verified your PayPal account.\nWe will not send cheques to post office boxes.\nIf you would like us to send a cheque to an address that does not meet these criteria, you must contact customer service and provide the documentation that we request to verify your association with the address.\nIf you fail to cash a cheque within 180 Days of the date of issuance, we will return the funds to your balance (minus a fee).<\/p> Managing Your Balance in Multiple Currencies Holding multiple currencies <p>Your PayPal balance may be held in any of the currencies supported by PayPal, and you may hold a balance in more than one of these currencies at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your PayPal account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the balance into another currency.\nIf you convert the balance in your account, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of your balance that you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.<\/li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the balance in the opening currency of your account or such other currency that PayPal supports for withdrawal in your registered country/region.\nIn order to withdraw the balance in your account which is held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate, including our currency conversion fee, will be used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To receive funds in a currency that your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your PayPal account in that currency or convert the balance into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in your PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.<\/p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).<\/p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe currency conversion fee applicable can be found on our fees page under the heading Currency conversion fees.<\/p>Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and involves a currency conversion by PayPal, you consent to and authorize us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nThis currency preference selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and the fees they may charge.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use your existing PayPal balance or your linked bank account is the payment method.<\/p> Account Statements Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSending payments and buying Sending payments to or Receiving payments from a Friend or Family Member Sending payments <p>In some countries/regions, you can send funds to a friend or family member from your PayPal account using the send payments feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called personal payments or peer-to-peer/P2P payments).\n<\/p>\n<p>Visit our Available Services by Country/Region of Residence list to see which services are available in your country/region of residence or log into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>You can send funds to a friend or family member even if they don't have a PayPal account at the time you send them funds, using their email address or mobile number, in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending funds does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't claim it, it will be refunded to you.\nReceiving funds from a friend or family member is described under <strong>Receiving Funds<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of funds you can send, including funds you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging in to your PayPal account.\nWe may increase your sending limits if you complete the same steps to verify your information as is required for the removal of withdrawal limits.<\/p>\n<p>When you send funds to a friend or family member, one of three things may happen: they may accept, decline or fail to claim the funds.\nIf they either decline to accept the funds or don't claim them within 30 days of the date they are sent, the funds (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal Credit as the payment method, or<\/li>\n<li>Your PayPal balance, if you used your PayPal balance as the payment method or a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Receiving payments <p>If a friend or family member sends funds to you, the funds will appear in your PayPal balance.\nTo receive funds in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the funds into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the balance into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the balance is converted, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p> Fees for Sending payments to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending funds can be found in our Sending funds table and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send funds to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert your PayPal balance from one currency to another, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you send funds to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party's product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.<\/p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal in any currency that the seller accepts, and that PayPal supports, using the funds in your PayPal balance, or using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer's website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Sending a payment to a seller for good or services.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller's physical store.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don't open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.<\/p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third-party websites or applications, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>American Express may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as branded airlines and certain travel merchants;<\/li>\n<li>Some credit cards may not be available as a payment method for certain merchants, such as those in the gambling industry.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Credit cards cannot be used to send personal payments or to top up your PayPal balance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied as described in the How we convert currency section and will be determined at the time the payment is processed.<\/p>\nFees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you don't pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>Your credit card or debit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for transactions.<\/p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don't clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\nAutomatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows the seller to take funds from your PayPal account with your authorization on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>You may cancel an automatic payment up to 3 Business Days before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the PayPal Help Centre.\nOnce an automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller funds for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for and you may be required to pay the seller through alternative means.<\/p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs a currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal's currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a credit card, debit card or PayPal balance.\nIf you used a bank account as the payment method for the transaction, we will refund the payment to your bank account, or to your PayPal balance if we cannot refund it to your bank account.\nFor purchases you make in a seller's store location that you paid for using your PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the payment will be refunded to your PayPal balance.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal performed a currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>within 1 day of the date of the original payment, the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) used at the time of the original payment will apply.<\/li>\n<li>beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) on the date of the refund will apply.\nThe transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.\nThis means that you may not receive the full amount of your original payment due to the fees above and fluctuations in currency conversion rates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Payments will be refunded in the currency you paid, or if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.<\/p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction Selecting a preferred payment method <p>In certain countries, you can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.<\/p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions and automatic payments with a seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.\n<\/p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the \"Manage\" link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.<\/p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.<\/p> Sending payments to friends and family <p>When you send payments to friends and family using your PayPal balance (if available) or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the \"Change\" link on the Send Payments page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send the payment.<\/p>\nAutomatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way to pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can select a payment method for future purchases with a particular seller either at the time of creating the agreement or in your account settings.\nFor example, you can instruct your monthly movie subscription service to always charge your credit card for the monthly cost.<\/p>\n<p>If your chosen payment method is unavailable (e.g.\ncredit card expired), a particular agreement with a seller does not provide for the ability to specify a payment method, or if you have not designated a payment method for future transactions with a seller, the payment method used will be in the following order, as applicable: 1.\nbalance.\n2.\nbank account (instant transfer).\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\ndebit card.\n6.\ncredit card.\nand 7.\neCheque.<\/p>\n<p>You can cancel any agreement in your account settings.<\/p>\nBank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.<\/p> eCheque <p>eCheque is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside of your country/region.<\/p>\n<p>If eCheque is your preferred payment method, it will be used to fund your PayPal payment, even if you have a balance.<\/p> PayPal’s Buyer Protection Program PayPal Buyer Protection <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal's Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Buyer Protection program.\nPayPal's original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal's Buyer Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal's Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an \"Item Not Received\" claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a \"Significantly Not as Described\" claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Buyer Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions.<\/p>\nItem Not Received claims <p>Your claim <em>will not<\/em> qualify for a refund under PayPal's Buyer Protection program for an Item Not Received claim if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller's store location, or<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to your address, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p> Significantly Not As Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller's description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as \"new\" but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\nit is counterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn't receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was materially damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially similar to the seller's description of it.<\/li>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as \"used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIneligible items and transactions under PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in all or part of a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller's store location.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government agency.<\/li>\n<li>Stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal payments.\n<\/li>\n<li>Payments sent using PayPal to any bill payment service.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay or guest checkout transactions (i.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account).<\/li>\n<li>Send payment transactions where the sender pays the PayPal transaction fee.<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nTransaction eligibility for PayPal's Buyer Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.\n<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Centre within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, and follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nOur online dispute resolution process <p>If you're unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Centre to pursue a claim under our Buyer Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 1:<\/strong>\n<strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 2:<\/strong>\n<strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the Resolution Centre.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 3:<\/strong>\n<strong>Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 4:<\/strong>\n<strong>Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you're filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.<\/p>\nProof of delivery means: <p>For transactions that total less than $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/ or postal code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.<\/p>\n<p>For transactions that total $750 USD (or the equivalent currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery (except for buyers having a PayPal account registered: in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Iceland, Israel, or Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Signature<\/strong>\n<strong>confirmation currency

USD<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 5: PayPal will make a final decision<\/strong> (including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.<\/p>\n<p>In the event that PayPal makes a final decision in favour of the buyer or seller, each party must comply with PayPal's decision.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal finds in favour of a buyer, PayPal will reimburse the buyer for the full purchase price of the item and original shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>In a seller loses a claim, the seller will not receive a refund on the PayPal fees associated with the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If a seller loses a Significantly Not as Described claim due to the item sold being counterfeit, the seller will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you will not receive the item back.<\/p>\nDispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a credit card or debit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal's Buyer Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don't qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Buyer Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can't do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we'll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won't affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).\nBefore contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller's return policy.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nSelling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services Receiving personal payments <p>The ability to receive payments varies by country/region.\nYou can determine whether you have the ability to receive payments by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.<\/li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you a personal payment for a purchase.\nIf you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account's ability to accept payments from friends or family members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Terms.<\/p>\nNo surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.<\/p> Presentation of PayPal <p>You must treat PayPal payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, wherever PayPal’s branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal’s services or marks.<\/p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal service as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over any PayPal service.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising and other customer communications), you agree to display the PayPal services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.<\/p>\nTaxes, information reporting <p>Some of our fees may be subject to applicable taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including, for example, value-added tax, sales tax, income tax, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, \"taxes\") and, unless expressly noted, our fees are exclusive of applicable taxes.\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.<\/p> Your refund policy and privacy policy <p>You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy, where required by law.<\/p>\nPayment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you by email and/or through your PayPal account.<\/p> In-store payments <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace's or the third party application's buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a \"card not present\" transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.<\/p>\nAccepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer's account through preauthorized payments either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a \"billing agreement,\" \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,\" \"reference transaction,\" \"preauthorized debit or PAD\", \"preauthorized transfer, \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers:<\/p>\n<p>You must:<\/p>\n<p>You must not:<\/p>\n<p>Get each buyer's prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.<\/p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer's written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancellation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.<\/p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.<\/p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer's option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.<\/p> Automatic Transfer Countries <p>If you are a resident of an Automatic Transfer Country, then you have the ability to receive payments, but you must withdraw the full amount of your payment through an available withdrawal method.\nIf you do not do so, the amounts will be automatically withdrawn from your PayPal account to your withdrawal method on a regular basis.\nFor additional terms regarding Automatic Transfer, please click here.<\/p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments Standard transactions fees <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on the buyer's country/region.\nThe fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Commercial Payments Fees table.\nPlease note that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 14 days' advance notice of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.<\/li>\n<li>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.<\/li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Merchant rate <p>To qualify for our merchant rate, you must submit a one-time application, have a qualifying monthly sales volume, and have a business account in good standing.\nTo view Merchant rate criteria click here.<\/p>\nMicropayments Fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10 USD.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative PayPal balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the <strong>Micropayment Fees table<\/strong> will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of the Commercial Payments Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.<\/p>\n<p>By applying for Micropayments for Digital Goods, you agree that for digital goods transactions you receive up to the amounts in the <strong>table<\/strong>, then if a buyer opens a Dispute, PayPal may reverse the transaction, and remove the funds from your account without requiring the buyer to escalate the dispute to a claim.<\/p>\nPayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal's Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a PayPal business account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand<\/li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.\n<\/p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay services, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.<\/p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee described below).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account in the same currency as the original transaction.\nIf your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you refund (partially or fully) a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller will not be returned to you.\n(This will not apply to residents of Mainland China who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.)<\/p>\n<p>The buyer's account will be credited with the full payment amount, or a portion of the payment amount in the event of a partial refund, we'll retain the fixed fee portion of the fees you paid, and the amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.<\/p>\nPayments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Buyer Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.<\/li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven't opted out).<\/li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer's bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.<\/li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized.<\/li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement, the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy or any other agreement between you and PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of the payment sent to you may be calculated in that currency, using PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover your liability for the payment amount plus the fees, then this will result in a negative PayPal balance.\nAny negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your PayPal balance to eliminate it.\nIf you do not do so, PayPal may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>recover any amounts due to PayPal by debiting your balance;<\/li>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you;<\/li>\n<li>take any and all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nDispute fees<p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout<strong>.\n<\/strong>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee <\/strong>rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee <\/strong>rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee&nbsp;<\/strong>will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> amount will be determined when the dispute is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your disputes ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions<\/strong>\n<strong>, <\/strong>and all chargebacks from the buyer’s card issuer or reversals from the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>If your Disputes Ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.<\/p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee <\/strong>for disputes that are<em>:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal’s Seller Protection<\/strong> program.<\/li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a <strong>Standard Dispute fee.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>Decided in your favour by PayPal or your issuer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees <\/strong>may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.<\/p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.<\/p>\n<p>This Dispute fees section does not apply to residents of Malaysia who open a PayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\nChargeback fees<p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, PayPal will charge you a chargeback fee for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee will apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.<\/p>\n<p>The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is the amount specified on the Chargeback Fees table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the Chargeback fee table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.<\/p>\n<p>If a buyer files a chargeback, the card issuer, not PayPal, will determine who wins the chargeback.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee Table in the currency of the original transaction.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the Chargeback Fee Table the fee assessed in your primary holding currency.<\/p>\nImpact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal's Buyer Protection program and if you sell goods and services to and receive payments from buyers with PayPal accounts in countries/regions other than your own, you should also be familiar with the PayPal Buyer Protection available to buyers in each of those countries/regions.\nBuyers' rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find this information for PayPal's programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer's location at the top of the page and referring to the applicable user agreement for that geography.<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal's Buyer Protection program in any country/region:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be required to reimburse PayPal for your liability.<\/li>\n<li>Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back), and the PayPal fees that you were charged for the transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay's decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf your PayPal balance is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover such claim.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>We offer Seller Protection based on the Seller Protection program for the country/region you selected when you opened your account.\nThe Seller Protection program for the following countries/regions are part of this user agreement.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Central Europe, Middle East and Africa<\/strong> (excluding Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other countries covered by a country/region-specific User Agreement)<\/li>\n<\/ul> What's eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under <strong>Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks<\/strong>, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal's Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal's Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize or benefit from funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an \"<strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>\" and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They did not receive the item from you (referred to as an \"<strong>Item Not Received<\/strong>\" claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal's Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer's bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal's Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the <strong>Impact of various Buyer Protection processes on sellers<\/strong>.<\/p>\nBasic requirements<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You provide us with valid proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a tangible item except for items subject to the Intangible Goods Additional Requirements.<\/li>\n<li>You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.\nWe therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Centre.\nIf you do not respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.<\/li>\n<li>If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.\nOtherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.<\/li>\n<li>You must accept payment from a PayPal account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).<\/li>\n<li>The payment must be marked “eligible” or “partially eligible” in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or “eligible” in the case of Item Not Received claims, for PayPal's Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nItem Not Received additional requirement<p>To be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection program for a buyer's Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional requirements listed below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked \"eligible\" or \"partially eligible\" for PayPal's Seller Protection on the transaction details page.<\/li>\n<li>You must provide proof of delivery as described below.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Intangible Goods additional requirements <p>For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration requirements:<\/li>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third-party or if you have a native app integration.<\/li>\n<li>Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.\nWe will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<li>Paid standard transaction fees on the sale.<\/li>\n<li>Delivered the item and provide Proof of shipment or delivery for Intangible Goods.<\/li>\n<li>Provide signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table.\nIf the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nEstablishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment <p>\n<strong>Physical Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods:<\/p>\n<p>Proof of shipment<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery<\/p>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of shipment<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient that matches the shipping address on the transaction details page<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date of delivery and \"delivered\" status of the item or service.<\/li>\n<li>An address for the recipient showing at least the city, country, or postal zip code (or international equivalent).<\/li>\n<li>Signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes exceeds) the fixed amount (based on the currency of the payment) listed in the signature confirmation threshold table .\nSignature confirmation is online documentation, viewable at the shipping company's website, indicating that the item was signed for (save for Sellers having a PayPal Account registered in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Ukraine to whom such requirement won't apply).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT<\/strong>: Your choice of carrier and shipment options with that carrier can have a big impact on your ability to meet the proof of delivery requirements.\nPlease ensure, especially when shipping goods internationally, that your carrier can provide ‘delivered' status at the correct address, or your Seller Protection claim may be denied.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intangible Goods<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p> The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for intangible goods:<\/p>\n<p>For intangible or digital goods, proof of shipment or delivery means compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled.\nCompelling evidence could include a system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipient’s address (email, IP, etc.), where applicable.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Received or accessed by the

financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.<\/p>\nHolds<p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the funds shall not be available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.<\/li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.<\/li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHolds based on PayPal’s risk decisions<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe'll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.\n<\/p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 30 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account unless PayPal has a reason to continue to hold the payment.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you've uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 30 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we'll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved.<\/p>\nHolds related to Marketplace transactions<p>If you're a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third-party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third-party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third-party directly.<\/p>\nHolds based on disputed transactions<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we'll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we'll remove the funds from your PayPal account.<\/p>\nAccount Limitations<p>Limitations prevent you from completing certain actions with your PayPal account, such as withdrawing, sending or receiving payments.\nThese limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why we may limit your access to your PayPal account or the PayPal services, and/or limit access to your funds, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we'll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.<\/li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you've received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks selling an entirely new or high cost product, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we limit access to your PayPal account, we'll provide you with notice of our actions and the opportunity to request restoration of access if, in our sole discretion, we deem it appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>\nReserves<p>We may place a reserve on your PayPal account if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some of the transactions will be shown as \"pending\" in your PayPal balance, and you will not be able to withdraw funds in a \"pending\" status, in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors, and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, we'll notify you of our actions and the terms of the reserve.<\/p>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve<\/strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the funds you receive on day 1 are held and then released on day 91, 10% of the funds you receive on day 2 are held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve<\/strong> is a specific minimum amount that you're required to keep available in your PayPal balance at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we'll notify you of the new terms.\n<\/p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place as long as reasonably necessary as determined by PayPal.<\/p> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nLiability for Unauthorized Transactions Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n<\/p>\nWhat is an Unauthorized Transaction<p>An \"Unauthorized Transaction\" occurs when a payment is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.<\/p>\nWhat is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction<p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nReporting an Unauthorized Transaction<p>You should contact PayPal customer service immediately if you believe:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>there has been an Unauthorized Transaction sent from your account;<\/li>\n<li>there has been unauthorized access to your account;<\/li>\n<li>your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen.\nor<\/li>\n<li>any device you have used to access your PayPal account has been lost, stolen or deactivated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You must give us all the available information relating to circumstances of any Unauthorized Transactions, and/or misappropriated or unauthorized use of your account, and take all reasonable steps requested to assist PayPal in its investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If you notify us of an Unauthorized Transaction within 60 days of the transaction and we are satisfied that it was an Unauthorized Transaction, you will be eligible for 100% protection for the Unauthorized Transaction.<\/p> Error Resolution What is an Error<p>An \"Error\" means the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a processing error made by PayPal or its suppliers in which your PayPal account is mistakenly debited or credited, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.<\/li>\n<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nWhat is not considered an Error<p>The following are NOT considered errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>If you erroneously send a payment to the wrong party, or send a payment for the wrong amount (based on a typographical error, for example).\n(Your only recourse in this instance will be to contact the party to whom you sent the payment and ask them to refund the payment.\nPayPal will not reimburse you or reverse a payment that you have made in error.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nIn case of errors or questions about your electronic transfers<p>Contact us at our Resolution Centre.<\/p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name, email address and account number (if any).<\/li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.<\/li>\n<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.\nWe will complete our investigation within 10 Business Days after we receive your notification of the suspected error.\nIf we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, we will credit your PayPal account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the provisional credit during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nWe will notify you of the provisional credit within 2 Business Days of the crediting.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not provisionally credit your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nFor new PayPal accounts (the first transaction from your account was less than 30 Business Days from the date you notify us), we may take up to 20 Business Days to complete the investigation.<\/p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation of our decision.\nIf you received a provisional credit, we will remove it from your account and notify you of the date and amount of the debit.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If we determine that there was an error, we will promptly credit the full amount into your account within 1 Business Day of our determination.\nOr, if you have already received a provisional credit, you will be allowed to retain those amounts.<\/p> Processing Errors <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover.\nIf the error results in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You receive less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.<\/li>\n<li>You receive more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.<\/li>\n<li>Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: <ul>\n<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;<\/li>\n<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/li>\n<li>the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Processing errors are not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.<\/li>\n<li>Delays based on a payment review.<\/li>\n<li>Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.<\/li>\n<li>Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount that you are sending).<\/li>\n<\/ul> PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT\nOther Legal Terms Communications Between You and Us <p>You agree that PayPal and its affiliates may contact you by email for marketing purposes.\nYou may opt-out of receiving marketing communications when you open a PayPal account, by changing your account preferences or by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any PayPal email or receipt you receive from us.\nPlease allow up to 10 Business Days for the opt-out to take effect.\nWe will provide factual information about your account or the PayPal services, even if you have opted-out of receiving marketing communications.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide us your mobile phone number, you agree that PayPal and its affiliates may contact you at that number using autodialed or prerecorded message calls or text messages to: (i) inform you about your use of the PayPal services and/or service your PayPal accounts, (ii) investigate or prevent fraud, or (iii) collect a debt.\nWe will not use autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to contact you for marketing purposes unless we receive your prior consent.\nWe may share your mobile phone number with service providers with whom we contract to assist us with the activities listed above, but will not share your mobile phone number with third parties for their own purposes without your consent.\nYou do not have to agree to receive autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to your mobile phone number in order to use and enjoy the products and services offered by PayPal.\nYou can decline to receive autodialed or prerecorded message calls or texts to your mobile phone number in several ways, including, via an email transaction receipt, in your account settings, or by contacting PayPal Customer Service.\nHowever, we may still call you directly using other means if we need to speak with you.\nStandard telephone minute and text charges may apply.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal may communicate with you about any PayPal account or transaction information and the PayPal services electronically.\nIt is your responsibility to keep your primary email address up to date so that PayPal can communicate with you electronically.\nYou understand and agree that if PayPal sends you an electronic communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic communications, PayPal will be deemed to have provided the communication to you effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add PayPal to your email address book so that you will be able to view the communications we send to you.<\/p>\n<p>You can update your primary email address or street address at any time by logging into the PayPal website.\nIf your email address becomes invalid such that electronic communications sent to you by PayPal are returned, PayPal may deem your account to be inactive, and you will not be able to transact any activity using your PayPal Account until we receive a valid, working primary email address from you.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal reserves the right to close your account if you withdraw your consent to receive electronic communications.<\/p>\n<p>You will be considered to have received a communication from us, if it's delivered electronically, 24 hours after the time we post it to our website or email it to you.\nYou will be considered to have received a communication from us, if it's delivered by mail, 3 Business Days after we send it.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you're communicating with us about a matter where we've specified another notice address (for example, our Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors process), written notices to PayPal must be sent by postal mail to: PayPal Pte.\nLtd., Attention: Legal Department, 5 Temasek Boulevard #09-01, Suntec Tower Five, Singapore 038985.<\/p>\n<p>You understand and agree that, to the extent permitted by law, PayPal may, without further notice or warning, monitor or record telephone conversations you or anyone acting on your behalf has with PayPal or its agents for quality control and training purposes or for our own protection.\nYou acknowledge and understand that while your communications with PayPal may be overheard, monitored, or recorded not all telephone lines or calls may be recorded by PayPal, and PayPal does not guarantee that recordings of any particular telephone calls will be retained or retrievable.<\/p> PayPal's Rights PayPal suspension and termination rights <p>PayPal, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to suspend or terminate this user agreement, access to or use of its websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the PayPal services for any reason and at any time upon notice to you and, upon termination of this user agreement, the payment to you of any unrestricted funds held in your PayPal balance.<\/p> Security interest <p>As security for the performance of your obligations under this user agreement, you grant to PayPal a lien on, and security interest in and to, your PayPal balance in the possession of PayPal.<\/p>\nAmounts owed to PayPal <p>If your PayPal balance becomes negative for any reason, that negative PayPal balance represents an amount that you owe to PayPal.\nPayPal may set off these amounts from funds that are subsequently added to your PayPal account, either by you or from payments you receive.\nIf you have more than one PayPal account, we may set off a negative PayPal balance in one PayPal account against a PayPal balance in your other PayPal account(s).\nIf you continue using your PayPal account when it has a negative balance, you authorize PayPal to combine the negative balance with any debit or transaction sent from your account when that combination is disclosed to you in advance of initiating the debit or transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold funds in a PayPal account in multiple currencies, and the balance for one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, PayPal may set off the negative PayPal balance by using funds you maintain in a different currency.\nIf you have a negative balance in non-relevant currency for a period of 21 days or longer, PayPal will convert this negative balance to relevant currency.\nIn either case, a currency conversion will be necessary, and PayPal's transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the above, if you have a past due amount owed to PayPal, our affiliates, or eBay, PayPal may debit your PayPal account to pay any amounts that are past due.\nThis includes amounts owed by using our various products such as Xoom or Braintree.<\/p>\nInsolvency proceedings<p>If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of any bankruptcy or insolvency law, we'll be entitled to recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this user agreement.<\/p>\nAssumption of rights<p>If PayPal invalidates and reverses a payment that you made to a recipient (either at your initiative or otherwise), you agree that PayPal assumes your rights against the recipient and third parties related to the payment, and may pursue those rights directly or on your behalf, in PayPal's discretion.<\/p>\nNo waiver<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under this user agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.<\/p> Indemnification and Limitation of Liability <p>In this section, we use the term \"PayPal\" to refer to PayPal Pte.\nLtd.\nand our affiliates, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, joint ventures, service providers and suppliers.\nOur affiliates include each entity that we control, we are controlled by or we are under common control with.<\/p>\nIndemnification<p>You must indemnify PayPal for actions related to your PayPal account and your use of the PayPal services.\nYou agree to defend, indemnify and hold PayPal harmless from any claim or demand (including reasonable legal fees) made or incurred by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this user agreement, your improper use of the PayPal services, your violation of any law or the rights of a third party and/or the actions or inactions of any third party to whom you grant permissions to use your PayPal account or access our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, or any of the PayPal services on your behalf.<\/p>\nLimitation of liability<p>\n<strong>PayPal's liability is limited with respect to your PayPal account and your use of the PayPal services.<\/strong>

user agreement (however arising, including negligence), unless and to the extent prohibited by law.<\/p>\n<p>Our liability to you or any third parties in any circumstance is limited to the actual amount of direct damages.\nIn addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, PayPal is not liable, and you agree not to hold PayPal responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill, or reputation, profits, or other intangible losses or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from: (1) your use of, or your inability to use, our websites, software, systems operated by us or on our behalf (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) or any of the PayPal

effective for all users as of November 9, 2020.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to PayPal!<\/p>\n<p>This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal, Inc.\ngoverning your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nIt applies to U.S.\nPayPal accounts only.\nIf you are an individual, you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your state of residence to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.\nIf you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of, the United States or one of its territories to open a U.S.\nPayPal account and use the PayPal services.<\/p>\n<p>By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.\nThe terms include an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration on an individual basis.\nYou also agree to comply with each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you and the following additional policies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy<\/li>\n<li>Electronic Communications Delivery Policy (E-Sign Disclosure and Consent)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may revise this agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.\nThe revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.\nIf our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you at least 21 days advance notice for personal accounts and at least 5 days advance notice for business accounts.\nBy continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement, you agree to abide and be bound by those changes.\nIf you do not agree with any changes to this user agreement, you may close your account.<\/p> Opening a PayPal Account <p>We offer two types of PayPal accounts: personal PayPal accounts and business PayPal accounts, both covered by this user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>All PayPal accounts let you do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and receive money.<\/li>\n<li>Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.<\/li>\n<li>Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, or other payment options, including funds held as balance in a business PayPal account (if we have verified the required identifying information you provide to us) or funds held in a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account linked to a personal PayPal account if you choose to open a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nThe term “Cash Account” in this user agreement will be used to refer to either a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/li>\n<li>Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, Cash Account and other payment methods from others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.\nYou must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Personal PayPal accounts <p>If you primarily need to make purchases and send money to family and friends, a personal PayPal account is probably right for you.\nWith a personal PayPal account you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send and request money from friends and family.<\/li>\n<li>Buy goods and services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also use a personal PayPal account to receive money for the sale of goods and services and hold that money in a linked Cash Account or transfer it to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not open a Cash Account, but if you plan to use your personal PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should open a business PayPal account.\nYou can also convert your personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account should circumstances change.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Business PayPal accounts <p>We recommend business PayPal accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services or accept donations, even if your business is not incorporated.\nWith a business PayPal account, you can do things like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a company or business name as the name on your business PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Allow employees access to some of the features of your business PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Business PayPal accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>By opening up a business PayPal account or converting a personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.\nYou also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business PayPal account.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Commercial Entity Status <p>If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.\nIn this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Closing Your PayPal Account <p>You may close your PayPal account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.\nWhen you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to a personal PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any funds held in your Cash Account before closing your personal PayPal account, and closing a personal PayPal account will result in PayPal automatically closing any linked Cash Account.\nIf you have a business PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any balance from your business PayPal account before closing it, and if you have not provided the required identifying information to us, or if we are unable to verify the required identifying information you provide, you must transfer any balance in your business PayPal account to a linked bank account or debit card.\nYou cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your personal or business PayPal account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.<\/p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.<\/li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account has a negative balance.<\/li>\n<li>If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Link or Unlink a Payment Method <p>You can link or unlink certain payment methods such as a credit card, debit card, a U.S.\nbank account or PayPal Credit to your PayPal account.\nYou can also link a Cash Account to your personal PayPal account as a payment method and unlink the Cash Account by withdrawing all funds and closing it.\nPlease keep your payment method information current (e.g.\ncredit card number and expiration date).\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.\nIf you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.\nTo do this, we will charge $1.95 to the card.\nAfter the card is confirmed, we will immediately refund this amount to the card.<\/p> Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds Personal PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to your personal PayPal account cannot be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nWhen you receive money to your personal PayPal account, you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transfer the money via a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your personal PayPal account for free;<\/li>\n<li>transfer the money via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your personal PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Funds (for personal PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal;<\/li>\n<li>request PayPal to send the money to you by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nIf you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your linked Cash Account if you have one or hold the funds on your behalf and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.\nWe will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you;<\/li>\n<li>open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nA Cash Account is separate account from your personal PayPal account.\nIf you open a Cash Account, we will automatically link your Cash Account to your personal PayPal account.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You also cannot transfer money to your personal PayPal account to be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.\nYou will need to open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account, which can be used for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.\nMore information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Except as provided below, any balance in your Cash Account and any funds sent to you which have not yet been transferred to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not have a Cash Account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<\/p>\n<p>PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.\nYou will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.\nPayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.\nPayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from PayPal’s corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a PayPal Cash Card debit card as part of a Cash Account, have enrolled in Direct Deposit, or have established Goals in PayPal, such funds will have pass-through FDIC insurance as further detailed in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Business PayPal accounts <p>Money sent to a business PayPal account can be held directly as balance in the business PayPal account.\nThe balance functionality in your business PayPal account will differ depending on whether we have been able to verify the required identifying information that you provide to us.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>The required identifying information is:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For sole proprietorships: name, physical address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number.\nor<\/li>\n<li>For other types of business legal entities: business name, business address, taxpayer identification number, and proof of business existence.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we have not verified the required identifying information, a balance in your business PayPal account can only be held in your business PayPal account and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card or you can request PayPal to send you the money by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nYour balance may also be used to fund payments or money owed to PayPal, such as payments on your PayPal Working Capital account or monies owed for refunds or chargebacks.<\/p>\n<p>If we have verified the required identifying information, a balance can be held in your business PayPal account, transferred to a linked bank account or debit card, used to make purchases or send money to others.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a business PayPal account and we have verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you may transfer money to the balance of your business PayPal account from any bank account linked to your business PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer from your bank account.\nIf we have not verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you cannot add funds to your balance in a business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>You can withdraw balance from your business PayPal account by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>transferring it via a standard transfer to a bank account linked to your business PayPal account for free,<\/li>\n<li>transferring it via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your business PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal,<\/li>\n<li>withdrawing it from an ATM (automated teller machine) if you have a PayPal-branded debit card (fees may apply), or<\/li>\n<li>Requesting a check from us (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).\nIf you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your balance in your business PayPal account and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.\nWe will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Any balance you hold in your business account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<\/p>\n<p>PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.\nYou will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.\nPayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.\nPayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nHowever, the claim against PayPal represented by your PayPal funds is not secured by these investments and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from PayPal’s corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Restrictions on transfers or withdrawals from PayPal accounts <p>To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).\nIf we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.<\/p>\n<p>We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.\nCompleting two out of three of the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verifying your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>Linking and confirming your credit or debit card information.<\/li>\n<li>Providing your social security number.<\/li>\n<\/ul> Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies Holding currency other than U.S.\ndollars <p>Your balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, if you have one, may be held in currencies other than U.S.\ndollars.<\/p>\n<p>If you hold a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may allow you to convert the funds to balance in another currency.\nIf you convert funds in your account, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nWe may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.<\/li>\n<li>You may only withdraw the funds in U.S.\ndollars.\nIn order to withdraw funds in your account held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to U.S.\ndollars, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.\nPayPal’s currency conversion rate, including our currency conversion spread, will be used.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To receive money in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, in that currency or convert the money into another currency.\nCertain currencies can only be received by converting the money into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.\nIf the money is converted, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal Cash Account or business PayPal account.\nYou may not manage or convert multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.\nPayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> How we convert currency <p>If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion spread applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).<\/p>\n<p>For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.\nThe applicable currency conversion spread can be found on our Fees page under the heading Currency conversion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Currency conversion choices <p>When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines a currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorize PayPal to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.\nYou may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.\nCurrency preference selections may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, and may be made available individually for each card and for each automatic payment agreement.\nIf your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where your Cash Account balance, business PayPal account balance or linked bank account is the payment method.<\/p> Account Statements <p>You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.\nYou may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.\nIf you have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, you will receive two statements: one showing all transactions in your personal PayPal account and an additional statement showing only transactions involving your Cash Account.<\/p> Sending Money and Buying Sending Money to a Friend or Family Member Sending money <p>You can send money to a friend or family member using the send money feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called “personal payments” or “peer-to-peer/P2P payments”).\nYou can send money to a friend or family member even if they don’t have a PayPal account at the time you send them money, using their email address or mobile number in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don’t claim it, it will be refunded to you.<\/p>\n<p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can send, including money you send for purchases.\nYou can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>When you send money to a friend or family member who has a PayPal account, one of two things may happen: they may accept or decline the money.\nIf they decline to accept the money, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card, PayPal Credit, a Cash Account, or balance in a business PayPal account as the payment method, or<\/li>\n<li>The balance in your business PayPal account or the balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account if you used a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>If you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family <p>The fees applicable to sending money can be found on our Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family page and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send money to a friend or family member.\nIf you convert money in your Cash Account balance or in your business PayPal account balance from one currency to another before sending money, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nIf you use your credit card as the payment method when sending money, you may also be charged a cash-advance fee by your card issuer.<\/p>\n<p>If you send money to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third party’s product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.\nThis will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the send money feature in your PayPal account to pay for goods or services.\nYou will not be charged any transaction fee for sending money to purchase goods or services as long as you choose the “send money to pay for goods and services” feature in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, the seller will pay a fee.\nYou must not use the “send money to a friend or family member” feature in your PayPal account when you are paying for goods or services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p> Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal <p>&nbsp;<\/p> How to buy something <p>You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, in any currency that the seller accepts and that PayPal supports using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.\nThis includes, for example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buying something at an online retailer’s website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.<\/li>\n<li>Sending money to a seller for goods or services.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller’s physical store using an electronic terminal, subject to certain limitations.<\/li>\n<li>Using your PayPal account to buy something at a seller’s physical store using your own mobile device and a QR code, subject to certain limitations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.\nIf they don’t open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.<\/p>\n<p>In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.\nIn addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third party websites or applications.<\/p>\n<p>When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.\nIn these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.\nIn that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).\nIf you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.\nIf your payment requires a currency conversion by us, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a currency conversion spread) will be used, and may be the rate at the time the payment is processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Fees <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal you don’t pay a fee to PayPal.\nIf PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.\nYour debit or credit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for non-U.S.\ntransactions.<\/p>\n<p>In addition you may be required to pay a fee to PayPal if you are making a purchase using PayPal Business Payments and the seller discloses to you that you, as the buyer, must pay the fee.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payment review <p>When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.\nWhen this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.\nAs a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.\nIf we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.\nIf we don’t clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Automatic payments <p>You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.\nThis agreement is between you and the seller and allows you to pay the seller on a one-time, recurring or sporadic basis.\nExamples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a “billing agreement,” \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” \"preauthorized transfer\" or \"preapproved payment.\"<\/p>\n<p>If you have a personal PayPal account, you may cancel a recurring automatic payment up to 3 <strong>Business Days<\/strong> before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the <strong>PayPal Help Center<\/strong>, or by calling PayPal at (888) 221-1161.<\/p>\n<p>Once your automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.\nIf you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller money for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for.<\/p>\n<p>If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.\nIf the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.<\/p>\n<p>If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPal’s <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Refunds <p>When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a debit card, credit card, PayPal Credit, or a balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a personal PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your linked Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>If you used a bank account linked to a business PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.\nIf we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your balance in your business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller’s store location that you paid for using your personal PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your Cash Account if you have one.\nIf you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.<\/p>\n<p>For purchases you make in a seller’s store location that you paid for using your business PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your balance in your business PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>If you used Pay with Rewards to fund your transaction, your refund will be processed back as a dollar amount: depending on your card agreement with your issuer, your issuer may or may not credit your purchase back to your reward balance.<\/p>\n<p>If PayPal performed currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) used at the time of the original payment will apply.<\/li>\n<li>Beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including a <strong>currency conversion spread<\/strong>) on the date of the refund will apply.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Money will be refunded in the currency you paid.\nor if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.\nor we are unable to refund in your primary holding currency, then in U.S.\ndollars.<\/p> Payment Method Used for My Transaction <p>&nbsp;<\/p> Selecting a preferred payment method <p>You can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.\nYou can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences on <strong>www.paypal.com<\/strong> or in the PayPal app.\nThere may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.<\/p>\n<p>You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions, and each of your automatic payment agreements, as described below.<\/p>\n<p>If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.<\/p>\n<p>If no preferred payment method, it’s still your choice.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.\nYou can also click on the “Manage” link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Backup payment method <p>Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.\nIn those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.\nNote that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for in-store or automatic payments.\nIf PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Sending money to friends and family <p>When you send money to friends and family within the U.S.\nusing balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the balance in your business PayPal account, or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.\nRemember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the “Change” link on the Send Money page.\nIf you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send money.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Automatic payments <p>Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way you pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.\nOften, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.\nTo help minimize disruptions in your automatic payments, we may update your Payment Method information.\nsee Link or Unlink a Payment Method.<\/p>\n<p>When you first set up an automatic payment agreement, you may have the option to set up a preferred payment method for such agreement.\nYou can review, set, or change a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement in your account settings on paypal.com.<\/p>\n<p>Your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement will be used for transactions with that seller.\nIf you have available balance in a linked Cash or cash Plus account, that balance may be used before your preferred payment method.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not set a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement, or if your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement is unavailable (for example, because it is expired or has insufficient funds) the payment method used will be in the following order, if applicable: 1.\nCash Account (if one is linked to your personal PayPal account) or balance in your business PayPal account (if we’ve been able to verify the <strong>required identifying information<\/strong> you provide to us).\n2.\nBank account.\n3.\nPayPal co-branded debit card.\n4.\nPayPal co-branded credit card.\n5.\nDebit card.\n6.\nCredit card.\nand 7.\nE-check.\nThis is also the order of payment methods that will be used if a previously selected payment method to be used in a seller agreement is unavailable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Bank account transfers <p>When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.\nFor these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.\nYou authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.<\/p>\n<p>If you use your PayPal account to pay for an item and you select your bank account as the funding method for the transaction, remember that your PayPal account is issued to you by PayPal and not your bank.\nThe terms, benefits, and protections associated with your PayPal account may vary from those that apply to your bank account.\nIf you use your PayPal account to make a purchase that exceeds the balance in your linked bank account, you could incur overdraft fees, even if you chose not to allow overdrafts with your bank.\nSimilarly, the liability limits applicable to your PayPal account may differ from those applicable to your bank account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> E-check <p>E-check is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.\nThis process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside the United States.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Pay with Rewards <p>PayPal may allow you to redeem rewards associated with your eligible card(s) when making a purchase with your PayPal account through PayPal’s Pay with Rewards program.\nPayPal may share with and receive information from your issuer about your issuer accounts to complete the redemption of your rewards when using PayPal’s Pay with Rewards program.\nThe exchange of this information is necessary to complete the purchase when you select the Pay with Rewards redemption option.<\/p> All Pay with Rewards redemptions are subject to the terms of your card agreement with your card issuer.\nPay with Rewards is only available for eligible purchases with certain merchants, and PayPal or your issuer may limit, suspend, or terminate your ability to redeem rewards at any time in accordance with this user agreement and your card agreement.\nYour issuer determines the value of rewards redeemed through PayPal and available redemption methods (e.g., to pay for your purchase or for a statement credit).\nThere may be a delay between checkout and processing of your payment.\nOnly rewards available upon processing of your payment will be used.\nBecause your reward balance and/or transaction balance may change, whenever you request to redeem rewards for a purchase you also authorize PayPal to charge up to the full payment amount to your associated card if that happens.\nFor more information on redeeming rewards and how it works, please see About Payment Methods.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Debit card processing <p>PayPal will process your debit or prepaid card funded transactions through either the ATM debit network or the Visa, MasterCard or Discover network.\nIf we process your debit or prepaid card through an ATM debit network, we may provide you with the opportunity to switch to a Visa, MasterCard or Discover network by changing your preferences for that debit or prepaid card through your PayPal account profile.<\/p> Loyalty Cards <p>If you use the PayPal application on your mobile phone, you may store loyalty card numbers or bar codes, where applicable, for certain sellers in your PayPal account.\nWhen you store your loyalty card numbers or bar codes in your PayPal account, you will earn any rewards, subject to the seller’s loyalty card terms and conditions, at the time you make your payment to the merchant by presenting the stored loyalty card number or bar code to the seller at the point of sale.\nIt is your responsibility to make sure you have entered your loyalty card information correctly and that you update it as necessary.\nIt is also your responsibility to ensure that you are receiving the rewards to which you are entitled.\nPayPal is not responsible for managing your loyalty card account by offering this service and any questions about your loyalty card or associated rewards program should be directed to the seller who offers the card.<\/p> PayPal’s Purchase Protection Program <p>When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.\nWhen applicable, PayPal’s Purchase Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.\nPayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Purchase Protection program.\nPayPal’s original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.\nPayPal’s Purchase Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal’s Purchase Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You didn’t receive your item from a seller (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim), or<\/li>\n<li>You received an item, but the item isn’t what you ordered (referred to as a “Significantly Not as Described” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Purchase Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> QR Code Transactions <p>If you buy something from a seller in person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Item Not Received claims <p>Your claim <strong>\n<em>will not<\/em>\n<\/strong> qualify for a refund under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program for an Item Not Received claim, if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a seller’s physical store, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions, or<\/li>\n<li>The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Significantly Not as Described claims <p>An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is materially different from the seller’s description of it.<\/li>\n<li>You received a completely different item.<\/li>\n<li>The condition of the item was misrepresented.\nFor example, the item was described as “new” but the item was used.<\/li>\n<li>The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.\ncounterfeit).<\/li>\n<li>The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.<\/li>\n<li>You purchased a certain number of items but didn’t receive them all.<\/li>\n<li>The item was damaged during shipment.<\/li>\n<li>The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.<\/li>\n<li>The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.<\/li>\n<li>The item has minor scratches and was described as “used.\"<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program <p>Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Purchase Protection:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real estate, including residential property.<\/li>\n<li>Financial products or investments of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).<\/li>\n<li>Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats.<\/li>\n<li>Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms.<\/li>\n<li>Items prohibited by the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>For Item Not Received claims, items which you collect in person or arrange to be collected on your behalf, including items bought in a seller’s store location, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Industrial machinery used in manufacturing.<\/li>\n<li>Anything purchased from, or an amount paid to, a government agency.<\/li>\n<li>Stored value items such as gift cards and pre-paid cards.<\/li>\n<li>Gambling, gaming and/or any other activity with an entry fee and a prize.<\/li>\n<li>Personal Payments.<\/li>\n<li>Payments sent using PayPal to any bill payment service.<\/li>\n<li>Payments made using PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay or guest checkout transactions (i.e.\nnot sent using your PayPal account).<\/li>\n<li>Items intended for resale, including single item transactions or transactions that include multiple items.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Transaction eligibility for PayPal’s Purchase Protection program <p>To be eligible for PayPal Purchase Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a PayPal account in good standing.<\/li>\n<li>Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim through the Resolution Center.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.<\/li>\n<li>Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment and follow our online dispute resolution process.<\/li>\n<li>Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Our online dispute resolution process <p>If you’re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong> to pursue a claim under our Purchase Protection program.\nYou may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.\nThe steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: <strong>Open a dispute<\/strong> within 180 days of the date you made the payment.\nThis might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.\nWe will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: <strong>Escalate the dispute to a claim<\/strong> for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.\nYou can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the <strong>Resolution Center<\/strong>.\nThe seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.\nPayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.\n<\/p>\n<p>Step 3: <strong>Respond to PayPal’s requests for documentation or other information<\/strong>, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.\nPayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4: <strong>Comply with PayPal’s shipping requests in a timely manner<\/strong>, if you’re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.\nPayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Proof of delivery means:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For transactions that total less than $750 U.S.\ndollars (or the currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or zip code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.<\/li>\n<li>For transactions that total $750 U.S.\ndollar (or the currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery.\nIf the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p> Signature confirmation currency thresholds

MXN<\/p>\n<p>U.S.\nDollar:<\/p>\n<p>750 USD<\/p>\n<p>Step 5: <strong>PayPal will make a final decision <\/strong>(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.\nWe may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Dispute with us or your card issuer <p>If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.\nApplicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program.\nFor example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they don’t qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.<\/p>\n<p>You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Purchase Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.\nYou can’t do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.\nIf you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, we’ll close your dispute/claim with us.\nThis won’t affect the dispute process with your card issuer.\nIn addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.\nIf PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).<\/p>\n<p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the seller’s return policy.<\/p> Selling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services <p>&nbsp;<\/p> Receiving personal payments <p>If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.<\/li>\n<li>Not ask your buyer to send you money using the “send money to a friend or family member.” If you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal account’s ability to accept payments from friends or family members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.\nSuch further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> No surcharges <p>You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.\nYou may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Presentation of PayPal and Pay with Venmo <p>You must treat PayPal and/or Venmo as payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale where PayPal or Venmo branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.\nThis includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.\nFurther, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal or Venmo services or marks.\n<\/p>\n<p>In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal or Venmo services or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal or Venmo services.\nWithin all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or Venmo services or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.\nIf you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal or Venmo, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising, and other customer communications) you agree to display the PayPal or Venmo services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Taxes and information reporting <p>Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “taxes”).\nIt is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.\nPayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.<\/p>\n<p>You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process.\nFor example, PayPal is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of payments for goods and services you receive each calendar year into all of your PayPal accounts associated with the same tax identification number if you receive more than $20,000 in payments for good and services and process more than 200 transactions involving goods or services through those PayPal accounts in the same calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Your customer service information, refunds and returns policy, and privacy policy <p>You must publish customer service information with clear instructions on how your customers can contact you.\nSuch instructions must include at least: (1) one active customer service email address or active customer service URL to file tickets for assistance and/or (2) one active customer service telephone number.\nSuch information must be readily accessible for review by your customers.<\/p>\n<p>You must publish a refunds and returns policy.<\/p>\n<p>You must publish a privacy policy, where required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payment review <p>PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.\nIf PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.\nPayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.\nIf the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.\nOtherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.\nAll payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal's Seller Protection requirements.\nWe will notify you about payment reviews by email and/or through your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> In-store payments and QR code transactions <p>If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.\nYou may charge your customer’s account only for transactions that they have authorized.\nYou must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.\nYou agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.<\/p>\n<p>If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.\nYou must also not use QR codes intended for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.\nFor any buyer claims related to QR code transactions, you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Marketplace sellers <p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplace’s or the third party application’s buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.\nAny such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> PayPal Giving Fund <p>If you are a charity and hold a PayPal account, you may be eligible to participate in PayPal Giving Fund programs.\nPayPal Giving Fund is a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code as a tax-exempt public charity (Federal Tax ID: 45-0931286).\nIf you meet the eligibility requirements in the <strong>Nonprofit Certification Policy<\/strong> and are either a “Public Charity” under Section 509(a) of the Code or a \"Private Operating Foundation\" under IRS regulations, you may be automatically enrolled with PayPal Giving Fund upon acceptance of this user agreement.\nYou will receive an email from us confirming your enrollment.\nYour relationship with PayPal Giving Fund will be governed by the <strong>Nonprofit User Agreement<\/strong>, including receiving email communications from PayPal Giving Fund about its current and future partners about its programs.\nYou can opt out of email communications at any time in your <strong>PayPal Giving Fund profile<\/strong>.\nIf you don’t want to be enrolled or receive donations from PayPal Giving Fund, you can opt-out at any time by <strong>contacting us<\/strong>.\nFor more information, please see <strong>PayPal Giving Fund’s Policies<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Card not present transactions <p>Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a “card not present” transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Accepting preauthorized payments <p>As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyer’s account through preauthorized transfers either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.\nThis type of transaction is sometimes called a “billing agreement,” \"subscription,\" \"recurring payment,” “reference transaction,” \"pre-approved payment \" or \"automatic payment.\"<\/p> If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers: <p>You must:<\/p>\n<p>You must not:<\/p>\n<p>Get each buyer’s prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.<\/p>\n<p>Restart future payments without the buyer’s written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.<\/p>\n<p>Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancelation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.<\/p>\n<p>Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.<\/p>\n<p>Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyer’s option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range.<\/p> Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments <p>Your PayPal transaction fees depend on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the country of the buyer’s account or the currency of their card;<\/li>\n<li>whether you are registered as a charitable organization and have active 501(c)(3) status.\nYour 501(c)(3) status must be documented with PayPal to receive the rates applicable to charitable organizations, and those rates will apply only after you document your status with us.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Standard transaction fees <p>The fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Standard Transaction Fees table, with the fees applicable to charitable organizations founds on the Standard Transaction Fees for Charitable Organizations table for the charitable fees.\nPlease note that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.\nWe will provide you at least 21 days’ advance notice for personal PayPal accounts and at least 5 days’ advance notice for business PayPal accounts of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.<\/li>\n<li>If you refund a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned.<\/li>\n<li>If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Here or PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Micropayments fees <p>You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10.\nIn order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.<\/p>\n<p>If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the Micropayment Fees table will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of Standard Transaction Fees.\nIf you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.\nOnce a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees <p>PayPal’s Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.\nYou may be able to choose to send payments to PayPal accounts, Venmo accounts, or both.\nIn order to use these services, you must have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a business PayPal account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.\nand<\/li>\n<li>applied for and received our permission to use these services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.<\/p>\n<p>The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay service, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.\nThese fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.<\/p>\n<p>You can send money through Payouts or Mass Pay even if your receiver does not have a PayPal or Venmo account, as applicable, using their email address or mobile number.\nIf the person to whom you are sending money does not have a relevant account, they can claim it by opening one.\nIf they don’t claim it, it will be refunded to you in thirty (30) days.\nPayPal is not liable for amounts sent by you in error.\nPayPal shall have no responsibility to reverse any payout payment.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Your responsibility to notify PayPal of pricing or fee errors <p>Once you have access to any account statement(s) or other account activity information made available to you by PayPal with respect to your business account(s), you will have ninety (90) days to notify PayPal in writing of any errors or discrepancies with respect to the pricing or other fees applied by PayPal.\nIf you do not notify PayPal within such timeframe, you accept such information as accurate, and PayPal shall have no obligation to make any corrections.\nFor the purposes of this provision, such pricing or fee errors or discrepancies are different than Unauthorized Transactions and other electronic transfer<strong> Errors<\/strong> which are each subject to different notification timeframes as set forth herein.<\/p> Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks <p>&nbsp;<\/p> General information <p>If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee).\nWhenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account.\nIf a currency conversion is necessary (for example if the balance in your Cash Account or your business PayPal account for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, or if the buyer paid in a different currency), PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.\nPayPal’s transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.<\/p>\n<p>If you refund a payment for goods or services, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned to you.\nThe amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Payments that are invalidated and reversed <p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You lose a PayPal Purchase Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.<\/li>\n<li>You lose a Venmo Protected Purchase Program claim.<\/li>\n<li>Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection.\nThe card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.<\/li>\n<li>You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.<\/li>\n<li>eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you haven’t opted out).<\/li>\n<li>Our investigation of a bank reversal made by a buyer or the buyer’s bank finds that the transaction was fraudulent.<\/li>\n<li>PayPal sent the payment to you in error.<\/li>\n<li>The payment was unauthorized<\/li>\n<li>You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement or any other agreement between you and PayPal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated or reversed for any reason.\nIf the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of that payment may be calculated in that currency, using the PayPal transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) that applies at the time the refund or reversal is processed.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account doesn’t cover the payment amount due plus the fees, we may use any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to cover the amount due.\nIf the payment methods linked to your PayPal account don’t cover the amount due, this will result in a negative balance.\nA negative balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your balance to resolve it.\nIf you don’t, PayPal may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>engage in collection efforts to recover the amount due from you;<\/li>\n<li>take any or all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Dispute fees <p>PayPal will charge a <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be charged at either the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> rate or the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> rate.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> table, then the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\nThe <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Dispute fee<\/strong> amount will be determined when the dispute case is created.\nThe fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.\nFor example, for a dispute raised in September, your dispute ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July, and August.\nYour total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for <strong>Unauthorized Transactions<\/strong>.\nand all chargebacks from the buyer’s card issuer or reversals from the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>If your dispute ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.\nOtherwise, you will be charged the <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for each dispute.<\/p>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s<strong> Resolution Center<\/strong> that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Eligible for <strong>PayPal’s Seller Protection<\/strong> program.<\/li>\n<li>Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a Standard Dispute fee.<\/li>\n<li>Decided in your favor by PayPal or your issuer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will <strong>\n<u>not<\/u>\n<\/strong> be charged a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong> for disputes that are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inquiries in PayPal’s<strong> Resolution Center<\/strong> and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.<\/li>\n<li>Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an <strong>Unauthorized Transaction<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Sellers charged <strong>High Volume Dispute fees<\/strong> may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.<\/p>\n<p>Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a <strong>Standard Dispute fee<\/strong> or a <strong>High Volume Dispute fee<\/strong>, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Chargeback fees <p>For transactions that are not processed either through a buyer’s PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, then PayPal will charge you a <strong>Chargeback fee<\/strong> for facilitating the chargeback process.\nThis fee with apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer.<\/p> The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.\nThe chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee table and will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.\nIf the transaction was in a currency not listed in the <strong>Chargeback fee<\/strong> table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers <p>You should read and understand PayPal’s Purchase Protection program, Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program, and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection available to buyers in each of those countries.\nBuyers’ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.\nYou can find information about PayPal’s protection programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyer’s location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding user agreement.\nYou can find information on Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program in Venmo’s user agreement.<\/p>\n<p>If you lose a claim under PayPal’s Purchase Protection program in any country, or under Venmo’s Protected Purchase Program:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.\nIn some cases you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.<\/li>\n<li>If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.\nUnless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBay’s decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.\nIf the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.\nor<\/li>\n<li>create a negative balance in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<\/ul> PayPal's Seller Protection Program <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What’s eligible <p>If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal’s Seller Protection program.\nWhen it applies, PayPal’s Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount for debit and credit card-funded transactions.\nThere is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.\nBy accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal’s Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an “Unauthorized Transaction” claim), and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by Paypal.\nor<\/li>\n<li>They didn’t receive the item from you (referred to as an “Item Not Received” claim).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PayPal’s Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyer’s bank.<\/p>\n<p>This section describes PayPal’s Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Basic requirements <p>To be eligible for PayPal’s Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the United States.<\/li>\n<li>The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for

details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.\nIf you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a

valid proof of shipping and delivery.\n<ul>\n<li>The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person.\nprovided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Center.\nIf you

us;<\/li>\n<li>Take legal action against you;<\/li>\n<li>If you’ve violated our Acceptable Use Policy, then you’re also responsible for damages to PayPal caused by your violation of this policy.\nor<\/li>\n<li>If you are a seller and you violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal's damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.\nYou acknowledge and agree that $2,500.00 U.S.\ndollars per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.\nPayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we close your PayPal account or terminate your use of the PayPal services for any reason, we’ll provide you with notice of our actions and make any unrestricted funds held in the balance of your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account or in the balance of your business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, available for withdrawal.<\/p>\n<p>You are responsible for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by PayPal, any PayPal customer, or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this agreement, and/or your use of the PayPal services.<\/p> Holds, Limitations, and Reserves <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What are holds, limitations and reserves <p>Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.\nUnless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described here, we’ll provide you with notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these actions.\nTo request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Center or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.<\/p>\n<p>Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.\nWe may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.\nIn addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.\nWe have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.<\/p>\n<p>In order to facilitate PayPal’s actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPal’s reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Holds <p>A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.\nWhen PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.\nPayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.\nSome common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.<\/li>\n<li>Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.<\/li>\n<li>Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on PayPal’s risk decisions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.\nWhen we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.\nWe’ll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.<\/p>\n<p>Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 21 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account.\nWe may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if you’ve uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.\nThe hold may last longer than 21 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.\nIn this case, we’ll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved (but no longer than 180 days).<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds related to Marketplace transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you’re a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third party.\nThis is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third party.\nThese holds will appear in your PayPal account.\nIf you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third party directly.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holds based on disputed transactions<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.\nAny of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.\nIf we determine the transaction should not be reversed, we’ll lift the temporary hold.\nIf we determine the transaction should be reversed, we’ll remove the funds from your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Account Limitations <p>Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.\nLimitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.<\/p>\n<p>There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, we’ll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.<\/li>\n<li>If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.\nSimilarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.<\/li>\n<li>In order to comply with applicable law.<\/li>\n<li>If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.<\/li>\n<li>Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.\nExamples include: indications of poor selling performance because you’ve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.\nNormally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.\nHowever, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Reserves placed on business PayPal accounts <p>We may place a reserve on your business PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your business PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.\nWhen we place a reserve on your business PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the money in your business PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your business PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.\nWe make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long you have been in business.<\/li>\n<li>Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.<\/li>\n<li>Your business and/or personal credit history.<\/li>\n<li>Your delivery time frames.<\/li>\n<li>Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your business PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Rolling reserve<\/strong> is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.\nFor example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period – meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.\nRolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Minimum reserve<\/strong> is a specific minimum amount of money that you’re required to keep available in the balance of your business PayPal account at all times.\nThe minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we place a reserve on funds in your account, the funds will be shown as \"pending\" and we’ll notify you of the terms of the reserve.<br> If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, we’ll notify you of the new terms.<br>\n<\/p> Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process <p>If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.\nWe will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.\nUnless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.\nWe do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.\nWhen we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place longer than 180 days.<\/p> PayPal User Agreement Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors Protection from Unauthorized Transactions <p>To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.\nPayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.\nYou should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.\nWhen this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is an Unauthorized Transaction <p>An “Unauthorized Transaction” occurs when money is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction <p>The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> Reporting an Unauthorized Transaction <p>If you believe your PayPal login information has been lost or stolen, please contact PayPal customer service immediately or call: (888) 221-1161 or write: PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.<\/p>\n<p>Tell us AT ONCE if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using your login information or by other means.\nYou could lose all the money in your PayPal account.\nIf you tell us within 60 days after we provide you your PayPal account statement showing transfers you did not make, you will be eligible for 100% protection for Unauthorized Transactions.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if your PayPal account statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made with your PayPal login information or by other means, tell us at once.\nIf you do not tell us within 60 days after we provided the statement to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.\nIf a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods.<\/p> Error Resolution <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is an Error <p>An “Error” means the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When money is either incorrectly taken from your PayPal account or incorrectly placed into your PayPal account, or when a transaction is incorrectly recorded in your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You send a payment and the incorrect amount is debited from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>An incorrect amount is credited to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>A transaction is missing from or not properly identified in your PayPal account statement.<\/li>\n<li>We make a computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You request receipt or periodic statement documents that PayPal is required to provide to you.<\/li>\n<li>You request information concerning preauthorized (recurring) transfers to your PayPal account that PayPal is required to provide to you.<\/li>\n<li>You request additional information or clarification concerning a transfer to or from your PayPal account, including a request you make to determine whether an error has occurred.<\/li>\n<li>You inquire about the status of a pending transfer to or from your PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>You request documentation or other information, unless the request is for a duplicate copy for tax or other record-keeping purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered an Error <p>The following are NOT considered Errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.\nYou are responsible for transactions made in this situation.<\/li>\n<li>Invalidation and reversal of a payment as a result of the actions described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks.<\/li>\n<li>Routine inquiries about the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account.<\/li>\n<li>Requests for duplicate documentation or other information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> In case of Errors or questions about your electronic transfers <p>Telephone us at (888) 221-1161, contact us through the PayPal Resolution Center.\nor write us at PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.\nBox 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.\n<\/p>\n<p>Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us your name and account number (if any).<\/li>\n<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.<\/li>\n<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.<\/p>\n<p>We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly.\nIf we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, we will credit your PayPal account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your PayPal account.<\/p>\n<p>For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nFor new PayPal accounts, we may take up to 20 Business Days to credit your PayPal account for the amount you think is in error.<\/p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.<\/p> Processing Errors <p>We will rectify any processing error that we discover.\nIf the error results in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You receiving less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.<\/li>\n<li>You receiving more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.<\/li>\n<li>Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: <ul>\n<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;<\/li>\n<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.\nor<\/li>\n<li>the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Processing errors are not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.<\/li>\n<li>Delays based on a payment review.<\/li>\n<li>Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.<\/li>\n<li>Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount of money that you are sending).<\/li>\n<\/ul> Remittance Transfer Errors <p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is a Remittance Transfer <p>You may be protected for certain errors when you send money using a PayPal account outside of the U.S.\nA “Remittance Transfer” is a transaction that meets the following criteria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The payment is sent from a personal PayPal account that is used primarily for personal, family or household purposes,<\/li>\n<li>The payment is made for personal, family or household purposes,<\/li>\n<li>The payment is made using the send money feature through your PayPal account,<\/li>\n<li>The payment amount equals or exceeds $15 USD (excluding fees charged to you) or the foreign currency equivalent calculated using exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction, and<\/li>\n<li>The recipient of the payment has a PayPal account in a country outside the U.S.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Payments that you make at a merchant website or location by selecting PayPal as a payment option are not “Remittance Transfers.”<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What qualifies as a Remittance Transfer Error <p>A <strong>“Remittance Transfer Error”<\/strong> occurs if:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You paid an incorrect amount to send the Remittance Transfer.\nFor example, you were charged more than the total shown on the remittance transfer receipt you received (unless the total shown on the receipt was an estimate, and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes).<\/li>\n<li>PayPal made a computational or bookkeeping error, such as a miscalculation of the amount the recipient received.<\/li>\n<li>The amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt was not made available to the recipient, unless: <ul>\n<li>we stated in the remittance transfer receipt that we used estimates and the difference in the amount received and the amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, or<\/li>\n<li>the problem was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside our control.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Funds were available to the recipient later than the date of availability that was disclosed to you on the remittance transfer receipt or were not delivered, unless: <ul>\n<li>extraordinary circumstances outside our control caused the delay, and we could not reasonably anticipate those circumstances,<\/li>\n<li>delays resulted from fraud screenings, or were caused by requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Controls or similar requirements, or<\/li>\n<li>you (or someone assisting you) made the transfer with fraudulent intent.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>You request documentation or information concerning the Remittance Transfer, such as information required to determine if a Remittance Transfer Error occurred.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p> What is not considered a Remittance Transfer Error <p>The following are NOT considered Remittance Transfer Errors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An inquiry about the status of a Remittance Transfer, except where the funds from the transfer were not made available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability,<\/li>\n<li>A request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes,<\/li>\n<li>A change requested by the designated recipient, or<\/li>\n<li>A change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the

to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and check issuances are processed in a timely manner but PayPal makes no representations

<p>You and PayPal agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us will be resolved in accordance with the Agreement to Arbitrate provisions set forth below.\nPlease read this information carefully.\nAmong other things it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Affects your rights and will impact how claims you and we have against each other are

and address your concerns.\nIf we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, we aim to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.\nDisputes between you and PayPal regarding the PayPal services may be reported to customer service online through the PayPal Help Center at any time, or by calling (888) 221-1161 from Mon-Fri 5:00 AM to 10:00 PM PT and Sat-Sun 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM PT.<\/p> Agreement to Arbitrate <p>\n<strong>\n<em>Our Agreement<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and PayPal each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal, including without limitation federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\nThis Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em> Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and PayPal agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.\nUnless both you and PayPal agree otherwise, the arbitrator(s) may not consolidate or join more than one person’s or party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding.\nAlso, the arbitrator(s) may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s).\nAny relief awarded cannot affect other PayPal customers.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Arbitration Procedures<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.\nHowever, the arbitrator(s) can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.\nThe arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of this user agreement as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator(s) to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (referred to as the \"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other party, by certified mail, a completed Notice of Dispute.\nYou should send this notice to PayPal at: PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.\nPayPal will send any notice to you to the address we have on file associated with your PayPal account.\nit is your responsibility to keep your address up to date.\nAll information called for in the notice must be provided including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.<\/p>\n<p>If you and PayPal are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, you or PayPal may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nA form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at www.adr.org.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or PayPal may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and PayPal subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.\nIn cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or PayPal may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator(s) require otherwise.\nAny settlement offer made by you or PayPal shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator(s).<\/p>\n<p>The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PayPal customers, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PayPal customer to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Costs of Arbitration<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, PayPal will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.\nAny request for payment of fees by PayPal should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and PayPal will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, PayPal will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator(s) deem necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive.\nIn the event the arbitrator(s) determine the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse PayPal for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by PayPal on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Severability<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\nIf a court decides that any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in court.\nAll other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall be arbitrated under its terms.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Opt-Out Procedure<\/em>\n<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a new PayPal customer, you can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice.\nThe opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time.\nYou must mail the opt-out notice to PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.<\/p>\n<p>For your convenience, we are providing an opt-out notice form you must complete and mail to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nYou must complete this form by providing all the information it calls for, including your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the PayPal account(s) to which the opt-out applies.\nYou must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective.\nThis procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the user agreement will continue to apply.\nOpting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.<\/p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Future Amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate<\/i>\n<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision in the user agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against PayPal prior to the effective date of the amendment.\nThe amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by this Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal.\nWe will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on www.paypal.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing notice through email.\nIf you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your PayPal account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.<\/p> Intellectual Property
