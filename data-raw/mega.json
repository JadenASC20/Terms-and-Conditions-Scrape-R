Policy","url":"https://mega.nz/cookie","xpath":"/html/body/div[6]/div[2]/div[4]/div","text":" Our Cookie Policy <p> In this Cookie Policy and on our Cookie Settings page we collectively refer to browser cookies and all similar types of technologies (such as local storage, web beacons and device identifiers, which we talk more about below) as ‘Cookies’.\n<\/p>\n<p> In this Cookie Policy you can find out about the types of Cookies we use when you access our services and also what is done with the information collected from you via those Cookies.\nWe also explain how you can opt out of our use of Cookies where it is possible to do so.\n<\/p> Technologies We Use Browser Cookies <p> Browser cookies are small amounts of data that a website places on your computer or mobile device.\nThese browser cookies can be used to store information about the actions you take on the websites you visit, like the pages you’ve looked at and any preferences such as the language or screen layout that you’ve selected.\n<\/p>\n<p> Browser cookies and all the similar types of technologies we talk about further below, can identify your device, but they can’t identify you personally.\n<\/p>\n<p> Any browser cookies that we set when you visit our website or use our apps are called ‘first party cookies’ as we control them.\nHowever, when we use a browser cookie created by someone else (such as an advertising associate), it is referred to as a ‘third party cookie’ as we don’t control the data that is collected by that third party cookie.\n<\/p>\n<p> You can find out about the specific third party cookies we use by heading to the Third Party Cookies page in our Cookie Settings.\n<\/p>\n<p> On the Third Party Cookies page you can also find links to the privacy policy of each third party cookie that we use.\nThese specific third party privacy policies (and not this Cookie Policy or our Privacy and Data Policy) will govern how any information collected by those third party cookies is used.\n<\/p> Local Storage <p> Local storage works in a similar way to browser cookies.\nLocal storage consists of a small amount of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device.\nLocal storage has some technical advantages over browser cookies in terms of the amount of data it can store, how long it can exist for and the more efficient way it transmits information.\nLocal storage is also used in the same way as browser cookies for remembering things such as any preferences like the language or screen layout that you’ve selected.\n<\/p> Web Beacons <p> A web beacon is a tiny transparent image file placed on a webpage that can be used, often in conjunction with browser cookies, to track your visits to, and interaction with, the webpage.\nWeb beacons can also be used to track your journey across a website or a series of websites.\n<\/p>\n<p> When you open a page with a web beacon the small file is downloaded after sending a message to a remote computer across the internet where the original image is stored.\nThis message will include information such as your IP address and the time the web beacon was triggered.\nWeb beacons can be used to identify the elements of a webpage that you might have interacted with including specific adverts.\n<\/p>\n<p> Web beacons can also operate through a Beacon API to send tracking events such as page views directly to API servers.\n<\/p> Tracking URLs <p> These are specially formatted URLs that let us know when they have been clicked.\nThey help us track things like when a particular link in an email is clicked on or which option on a webpage is chosen more often.\n<\/p> Device Identifiers <p> When you access our services our system will generate a device ID (that doesn’t include the serial number, brand or model of your device) and assign this to our record of your device.\n<\/p>\n<p> We regard the use of device identifiers as being essential to offering you our services and therefore (as allowed by law) the use of device identifiers on our services cannot be turned off.\n<\/p> Cookie Categories <p> Based on the functionality they provide, we classify all the ‘Cookies’ we use (including browser cookies, local storage, web beacons, tracking URLs and device identifiers) into the following categories: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essential<\/li>\n<li>Preference<\/li>\n<li>Performance and Analytics<\/li>\n<li>Advertising<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> In our Cookie Settings you are able to select (with the exception of Essential Cookies as explained below) the categories of Cookies we can use whenever you access our services.\n<\/p> Essential Cookies <p> These are essential for providing you with important functionality and secure access to our services.\nWithout them, we couldn’t offer you the services we do.\nFor this reason, they do not require consent.\nWe use Essential Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> assist in securely connecting you to our services.\n<\/li>\n<li> ensure our technical infrastructure is operating efficiently in order to deliver our services to you in an optimal way.\n<\/li>\n<li> identify if you have previously requested the ‘remember me’ option so as to be automatically logged in when you return to use our services.\n<\/li>\n<li> determine if you have logged in and then keep you logged in for either the duration of your current session or for future visits as well if you have previously requested the ‘remember me’ option when logging in.\n<\/li>\n<li> identify and take action against malicious threats to our system.\n<\/li>\n<li> observe activity on our services and detect any actions which are against our Terms of Service or that may negatively impact on the quality of use of our services for other users.\nand <\/li>\n<li> assist you to make purchases from us.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Preference Cookies <p> These Cookies allow us to remember certain display and formatting settings you have chosen.\nNot accepting these Cookies will mean we won’t be able to remember some things for you such as your preferred screen layout.\nWe use Preference Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> remember the preferences you select for how various screens in our system should display (such as your Folder view in Cloud Drive) so that they can be displayed in the same way the next time you visit them.\nand <\/li>\n<li> remember the language you have chosen that you wish to use our services in.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Performance and Analytics Cookies <p> These Cookies help us to understand how you use our services and provide us data that we can utilise to make improvements.\nNot accepting these Cookies will mean we will have less data available to help make improvements.\nWe use Performance and Analytics Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> identify the parts of our services that you use more than others and how well different parts of our services function.\n<\/li>\n<li> observe the devices and settings you use when you access our services to help us to determine what improvements would be beneficial for us to make to our services.\nand <\/li>\n<li> monitor any changes we make to our services to see if they improve your user experience.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Advertising Cookies <p> These Cookies are used by us and our approved advertising partners to customise adverts which are shown by us on our services and by third parties on our services and on other websites and services.\nNot accepting these Cookies means you may be shown advertisements that are less relevant.\nWe and our approved advertising partners use Advertising Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> monitor how often you are displayed certain adverts.\n<\/li>\n<li> customise the adverts you see based on such things as your location and your actions on our services and the actions you have taken on other websites and services you have previously visited.\nand <\/li>\n<li> tell us when you click on a particular advert and then to track the following actions you take in response to that advert.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Managing Cookies <p> When you first access our services, you will be shown a brief message explaining what we use Cookies for.\nYou can either accept the use of all Cookies on our services, or if you do not wish to accept the use of some Cookies, you can go to our Cookie Settings to specify your preferences.\nThese preferences will be saved so that the next time you access our services you do not have to make your choices again.\nYou can also adjust the preferences you have selected at any time by accessing the Cookie Settings page again from the link in the footer of our website or from the Settings page in our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> Please note that if you choose to disable some or all Cookies in your browser, it will limit the functionality that different websites and services (including ours) can make available to you.\n<\/p> Related Terms <p> This Cookie Policy, our Terms of Service, our Privacy and Data Policy, and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in those documents, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nWhere there is any inconsistency between those documents, to the greatest extent at law, the Terms of Service prevail.\nAll defined terms in our Terms of Service shall have the same meaning in this Cookie Policy.\nTo the greatest extent permitted at law all limitations and exclusions of liability set out in our Terms of Service apply equally to this Cookie Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.<\/p> ","created_at":"2021-02-01 20:20:59.809525","updated_at":"2021-02-01

Policy Introduction <p> 1 This Policy governs our processing of your personal information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such

have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n<\/p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n<\/p> Mega’s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n<\/p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n<\/p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand

further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n<\/p> Contact and complaints

65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning

or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to

comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity

material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the

penalty of perjury (unless applicable law says otherwise), that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n<\/p>\n<p> 22 We reserve the right to remove data alleged to be infringing

our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been

faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile

also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import, or transfer any software or code supplied as part of your use of our services: (a) into any United States or New

provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS

place or be periodically interrupted for reasons outside our control.\n<\/p>\n<p> 43 Information provided on our services will change regularly.\nWe will try to keep the information up to date and correct, but again, we do not make any promises or guarantees about the accuracy of such information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 44 We do not warrant that the services will meet your requirements or that they will

permitted by law, any statutory consumer guarantees or legislation intended to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD,

(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTORY OR PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY,

INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive officer of Mega Limited.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last

communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your application after we have approved it pursuant to our application approval process and licence agreement available on request at api@mega.nz <\/p> Your IP <p> 19 You own, or undertake that you are authorised to use, any intellectual property in any data you store on, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit or otherwise make available to or from, our systems or using our services.\nYou grant us a worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, store, back-up, copy, transmit, distribute, communicate, modify and otherwise make available, your data, solely for the purposes of enabling you and those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 21.5 a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury (unless applicable law says otherwise), that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n<\/p>\n<p> 22 We reserve the right to remove data alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you.\nIn appropriate circumstances, we will also terminate your account if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

you with a warranty that the services will be without any faults, bugs or interruptions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 42 Whilst we intend that the services should be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is possible that on occasions our services may be unavailable to permit maintenance or other development activity to take place or be periodically interrupted for reasons outside our control.\n<\/p>\n<p> 43 Information provided on our services will change regularly.\nWe will try to keep the information up to date and correct, but again, we do not make any promises or guarantees about the accuracy of such information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 44 We do not warrant that the services will meet your requirements or that they will be suitable for any particular purpose.\n<\/p>\n<p> 45 You are the controller in respect of some data Mega holds about you and Mega is the processor, for GDPR purposes.\nMega is the controller in respect of some other data.\nSee our Privacy and Data Policy for more details.\nThese terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy are the contract between us that governs our processing of that data.\nIt is your sole responsibility to determine that the services meet the needs of you, your business or otherwise and are suitable for the purposes for which they are used.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46 We also aren't legally responsible for:

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY OR INABILITY TO USE, OR RELIANCE ON, OUR SERVICES, AND BASED ON ANY TYPE OF LIABILITY INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTORY OR PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your

authorised to use, any intellectual property in any data you store on, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit or otherwise make available to or from, our systems or using our services.\nYou grant us a worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, store, back-up, copy, transmit, distribute, communicate, modify and otherwise make available, your data, solely for the purposes of enabling you and those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or

the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import, or transfer any software or code supplied as part of your use of our services: (a) into any United States or New Zealand embargoed countries.\nor (b) to anyone listed as a specifically prohibited recipient by the United States Government or the New Zealand Government.\nBy using our websites and our services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.\nYou also will not use our websites or our services for any purpose prohibited by United States, New Zealand or any other law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection,

respect of some data Mega holds about you and Mega is the processor, for GDPR purposes.\nMega is the controller in respect of some other data.\nSee our Privacy and Data Policy for more details.\nThese terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy are the contract between us that governs our processing of that data.\nIt is your sole responsibility to

of any data that you upload, access or share.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46.4.2 content of ads appearing on our services (including links to advertisers' own websites) as the advertisers are responsible for the ads and we don't endorse the advertisers' products.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 46.4.3 content of other people's websites even if a link to their websites is included on our websites or our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p>

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF

OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive officer of Mega Limited.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.<\/p> ","created_at":"2018-09-10

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can

Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such entities are located in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n<\/p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n<\/p> Mega’s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n<\/p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n<\/p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand law.\nSubject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, you, MEGA and all users, submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals and courts as further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n<\/p> Contact and complaints <p> 23 Questions and comments regarding this Policy are welcomed and should be addressed to the Privacy Officer at privacy@mega.nz.\nFor a comprehensive list of contact details for Mega Limited, and

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such entities are located in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n<\/p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n<\/p> Mega’s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n<\/p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n<\/p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand law.\nSubject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, you, MEGA and all users, submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals and courts as further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n<\/p> Contact and complaints

Counter-Notices 23-30 Other Infringement Notices 31 Suspension and Termination 32-36 Export Control 37 Severability and Waiver 38 Force Majeure 39 Disclaimers 40-47 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your application after we have approved it pursuant to our application approval process and licence agreement available on request at api@mega.nz <\/p> Your IP <p> 19 You own, or undertake that you are authorised to use, any intellectual property in any data you store on, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit or otherwise make available to or from, our systems or using our services.\nYou grant us a worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, store, back-up, copy, transmit, distribute, communicate, modify and otherwise make available, your data, solely for the purposes of enabling you and those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 21.5 a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury (unless applicable law says otherwise), that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n<\/p>\n<p> 22 We reserve the right to remove data alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you.\nIn appropriate circumstances, we will also terminate your account if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using

companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms

purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo

communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit

others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share,

person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

47 You warrant that if you are accessing and using the services for the purposes of a business then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any statutory consumer guarantees or legislation intended to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY

OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive officer of Mega Limited.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.<\/p> ","created_at":"2018-09-10

manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>”

data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3

terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your application after we have approved it pursuant to our application approval process and licence agreement available on request at api@mega.nz <\/p> Your IP <p> 19 You own, or undertake that you are

those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 21.5 a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury (unless applicable law says otherwise), that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n<\/p>\n<p> 22 We reserve the right to remove data alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you.\nIn appropriate circumstances, we will also terminate your account if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

such information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 44 We do not warrant that the services will meet your requirements or that they will be suitable for any particular purpose.\n<\/p>\n<p> 45 You are the controller in respect of some data Mega holds about you and Mega is the processor, for GDPR purposes.\nMega is the controller in respect of some other data.\nSee our Privacy and Data Policy for more details.\nThese

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT

PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY

DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive officer of Mega Limited.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.<\/p> ","created_at":"2018-09-10

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your application after we have approved it pursuant to our application approval process and licence agreement available on request at api@mega.nz <\/p> Your IP <p> 19 You own, or undertake that you are authorised to use, any intellectual property in any data you store on, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit or otherwise make available to or from, our systems or using our services.\nYou

those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages

from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or

the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the

webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further

respect of some data Mega holds about you and Mega is the processor, for GDPR purposes.\nMega is the controller in respect of some other data.\nSee our Privacy and Data Policy for more details.\nThese terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy are the contract between us that governs our processing of that data.\nIt is your sole responsibility to

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF

OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive officer of Mega Limited.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.<\/p> ","created_at":"2018-09-10

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such entities are located in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n<\/p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n<\/p> Mega’s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n<\/p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n<\/p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand law.\nSubject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, you, MEGA and all users, submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals and courts as further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n<\/p> Contact and complaints <p> 23 Questions and comments regarding this Policy are welcomed and should be addressed to the Privacy Officer at privacy@mega.nz.\nFor a comprehensive list of contact details for Mega Limited, and

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your

others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's

security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in

request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n<\/p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand

further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n<\/p> Contact and complaints

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your

those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 21.5 a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury (unless applicable law says otherwise), that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n<\/p>\n<p> 22 We

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF

SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using

companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other

others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share,

misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed

has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or

you with a warranty that the services will be without any faults, bugs or interruptions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 42 Whilst we intend that the services should be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is possible that on occasions our services may be unavailable to permit maintenance or other development activity to take place or be periodically interrupted for reasons outside our control.\n<\/p>\n<p>

such information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 44 We do not warrant that the services will meet your requirements or that they will be suitable for any particular purpose.\n<\/p>\n<p> 45 You are the controller in respect of some data Mega holds about you and Mega is the processor, for GDPR purposes.\nMega is the controller in respect of some other data.\nSee our Privacy and Data Policy for more details.\nThese

47 You warrant that if you are accessing and using the services for the purposes of a business then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any statutory consumer guarantees or legislation intended to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY

OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms

purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into

communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and

person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages

from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process

that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the

the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the

has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out

the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or

RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim

these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using

companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your

those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using

companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other

others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share,

should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original

the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import, or transfer any software or code supplied as part of your use of our services: (a) into any United States or New Zealand embargoed countries.\nor (b) to anyone listed as a specifically prohibited recipient by the United States Government or the New Zealand Government.\nBy using our websites and our services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.\nYou also will not use our websites or our services for any purpose prohibited by United States, New Zealand or any other law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

you with a warranty that the services will be without any faults, bugs or interruptions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 42 Whilst we intend that the services should be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is possible that on occasions our services may be unavailable to permit maintenance or other development activity to take place or be periodically interrupted for reasons outside our control.\n<\/p>\n<p>

such information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 44 We do not warrant that the services will meet your requirements or that they will be suitable for any particular purpose.\n<\/p>\n<p> 45 You are the controller in respect of some data Mega holds about you and Mega is the processor, for GDPR purposes.\nMega is the controller in respect of some other data.\nSee our Privacy and Data Policy for more details.\nThese

determine that the services meet the needs of you, your business or otherwise and are suitable for the purposes for which they are used.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46 We also aren't legally responsible for:

and we don't endorse the advertisers' products.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 46.4.3 content of other people's websites even if a link to their websites is included on our websites or our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 47 You warrant that if you are accessing and using the services for the purposes of a business then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any statutory consumer guarantees or legislation intended to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY

OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using

companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property

person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages

from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out

immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or

RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim

English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your application after we have approved it pursuant to our application approval process and licence agreement available on request at api@mega.nz <\/p> Your IP <p> 19 You own, or undertake that you are

those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 21.5 a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury (unless applicable law says otherwise), that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n<\/p>\n<p> 22 We reserve the right to remove data alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you.\nIn appropriate circumstances, we will also terminate your account if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated

English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses

these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your

others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction

voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the

the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section

above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any

immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or

you with a warranty that the services will be without any faults, bugs or interruptions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 42 Whilst we intend that the services should be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT

PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY

OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other

been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT

SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using

companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your application after we have approved it pursuant to our application approval process and licence agreement available on request at api@mega.nz <\/p> Your IP <p> 19 You own, or undertake that you are authorised to use, any intellectual property in any data you store on, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit or otherwise make available to or from, our systems or using our services.\nYou grant us a worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, store, back-up, copy, transmit, distribute, communicate, modify and otherwise make available, your data, solely for the purposes of enabling you and those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 21.5 a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury (unless applicable law says otherwise), that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n<\/p>\n<p> 22 We reserve the right to remove data alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you.\nIn appropriate circumstances, we will also terminate your account if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF

RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim

these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your

those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when

voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the

the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the

webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out

that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import, or transfer any software or code supplied as part of your use of our services: (a) into any United States or New Zealand embargoed countries.\nor (b) to anyone listed as a specifically prohibited recipient by the United States Government or the New Zealand Government.\nBy using our websites and our services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.\nYou also will not use our websites or our services for any purpose prohibited by United States, New Zealand or any other law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or

performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

you with a warranty that the services will be without any faults, bugs or interruptions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 42 Whilst we intend that the services should be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is possible that on occasions our services may be unavailable to permit maintenance or other development activity to take place or be periodically interrupted for reasons outside our control.\n<\/p>\n<p> 43 Information provided on our services will change regularly.\nWe will try to keep the information up to date and correct, but again, we do not make any promises or guarantees about the accuracy of such information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 44 We do not warrant that the services will meet your requirements or that they will be suitable for any particular purpose.\n<\/p>\n<p> 45 You are the controller in respect of some data Mega holds about you and Mega is the processor, for GDPR purposes.\nMega is the controller in respect of some other data.\nSee our Privacy and Data Policy for more details.\nThese terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy are the contract between us that governs our processing of that data.\nIt is your sole responsibility to determine that the services meet the needs of you, your business or otherwise and are suitable for the purposes for which they are used.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46 We also aren't legally responsible for:

and we don't endorse the advertisers' products.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 46.4.3 content of other people's websites even if a link to their websites is included on our websites or our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 47 You warrant that if you are accessing and using the services for the purposes of a business then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any statutory consumer guarantees or legislation intended to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY OR INABILITY TO USE, OR RELIANCE ON, OUR SERVICES, AND BASED ON ANY TYPE OF LIABILITY INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTORY OR PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to

person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT

DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your application after we have approved it pursuant to our application approval process and licence agreement available on request at api@mega.nz <\/p> Your IP <p> 19 You own, or undertake that you are authorised to use, any intellectual property in any data you store on, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit or otherwise make available to or from, our systems or using our services.\nYou grant us a worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, store, back-up, copy, transmit, distribute, communicate, modify and otherwise make available, your data, solely for the purposes of enabling you and those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 21.5 a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury (unless applicable law says otherwise), that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n<\/p>\n<p> 22 We reserve the right to remove data alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you.\nIn appropriate circumstances, we will also terminate your account if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

you with a warranty that the services will be without any faults, bugs or interruptions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 42 Whilst we intend that the services should be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is possible that on occasions our services may be unavailable to permit maintenance or other development activity to take place or be periodically interrupted for reasons outside our control.\n<\/p>\n<p> 43 Information provided on our services will change regularly.\nWe will try to keep the information up to date and correct, but again, we do not make any promises or guarantees about the accuracy of such information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 44 We do not warrant that the services will meet your requirements or that they will be suitable for any particular purpose.\n<\/p>\n<p> 45 You are the controller in respect of some data Mega holds about you and Mega is the processor, for GDPR purposes.\nMega is the controller in respect of some other data.\nSee our Privacy and Data Policy for more details.\nThese

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT

PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY

OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,

DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive officer of Mega Limited.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.<\/p> ","created_at":"2018-09-10

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your

authorised to use, any intellectual property in any data you store on, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit or otherwise make available to or from, our systems or using our services.\nYou grant us a worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, store, back-up, copy, transmit, distribute, communicate, modify and otherwise make available, your data, solely for the purposes of enabling you and those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages

from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or

the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection,

SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using

companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into

communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other

others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other

others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 21.5 a statement that the

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

determine that the services meet the needs of you, your business or otherwise and are suitable for the purposes for which they are used.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46 We also aren't legally responsible for: <\/p>\n<p> 46.1 any corruption or loss of data or other content which you or anyone else may experience after using our services or any problems you may have when you access our services.\n<\/p>\n<p>

47 You warrant that if you are accessing and using the services for the purposes of a business then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any statutory consumer guarantees or legislation intended to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY

OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive officer of Mega Limited.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.<\/p> ","created_at":"2018-09-10

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such entities are located in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n<\/p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n<\/p> Mega’s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n<\/p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n<\/p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand law.\nSubject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, you, MEGA and all users, submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals and courts as further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n<\/p> Contact and complaints

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such entities are located in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n<\/p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n<\/p> Mega’s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n<\/p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n<\/p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand law.\nSubject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, you, MEGA and all users, submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals and courts as further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n<\/p> Contact and complaints <p> 23 Questions and comments regarding this Policy are welcomed and should be addressed to the Privacy Officer at privacy@mega.nz.\nFor a comprehensive list of contact details for Mega Limited, and each of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, together with details of how to contact our privacy officer and data protection officer, see our contacts

supervisory authority on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Changes to our Policy <p> 24 We may make changes to this Policy in the future.\nAny changes will be notified to all users.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such entities are located in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n<\/p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n<\/p> Mega’s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n<\/p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n<\/p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand law.\nSubject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, you, MEGA and all users, submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals and courts as further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n<\/p> Contact and complaints <p> 23 Questions and comments regarding this Policy are welcomed and should be addressed to the Privacy Officer at privacy@mega.nz.\nFor a comprehensive list of contact details for Mega Limited, and each of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, together with details of how to contact our privacy officer and data protection officer, see our contacts

supervisory authority on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Changes to our Policy <p> 24 We may make changes to this Policy in the future.\nAny changes will be notified to all users.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18

MEGA LIMITED TERMS OF SERVICE (\"TERMS\") Scope of these terms 1-5 Your data 6-10 Your obligations 11-14 What you can't do 15-16 Our IP 17-18 Your IP 19 Copyright Infringement Notices 20-22 Copyright Counter-Notices 23-30 Other Infringement Notices 31 Suspension and Termination 32-36 Export Control 37 Severability and Waiver 38 Force Majeure 39 Disclaimers 40-47 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your

those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has

We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original

voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import, or transfer any software or code supplied as part of your use of our services: (a) into any United States or New Zealand embargoed countries.\nor (b) to anyone listed as a specifically prohibited recipient by the United States Government or the New Zealand Government.\nBy using our websites and our services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.\nYou also will not use our websites or our services for any purpose prohibited by United States, New Zealand or any other law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PURPOSE, SAFETY, RELIABILITY, DURABILITY, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n<\/p>\n<p> 41 We will try to give you access to our services all the time, but we do not make any promises or provide you with a warranty that the services will be without any faults, bugs or interruptions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 42 Whilst we intend that the services should be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is possible that on occasions our services may be unavailable to permit maintenance or other development activity to take place or be periodically interrupted for reasons outside our control.\n<\/p>\n<p> 43 Information provided on our services will change regularly.\nWe will try to keep the information up to date and correct, but again, we do not make any promises or guarantees about the accuracy of such information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 44 We do not warrant that the services will meet your requirements or that they will be suitable for any particular purpose.\n<\/p>\n<p> 45 You are the controller in respect of some data Mega holds about you and Mega is the processor, for GDPR purposes.\nMega is the controller in respect of some other data.\nSee our Privacy and Data Policy for more details.\nThese terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy are the contract between us that governs our processing of that data.\nIt is your sole responsibility to determine that the services meet the needs of you, your business or otherwise and are suitable for the purposes for which they are used.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46 We also aren't legally responsible for: <\/p>\n<p> 46.1 any corruption or loss of data or other content which you or anyone else may experience after using our services or any problems you may have when you access our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46.2 devices or equipment that we do not own or have not given you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46.3 any loss or damage if you do not follow our reasonable instructions, these terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 46.4 any actions or non-actions of other people which disrupt access to our services, including the <\/p>\n<p> 46.4.1 content and nature of any data that you upload, access or share.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46.4.2 content of ads appearing on our services (including links to advertisers' own websites) as the advertisers are responsible for the ads and we don't endorse the advertisers' products.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 46.4.3 content of other people's websites even if a link to their websites is included on our websites or our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 47 You warrant that if you are accessing and using the services for the purposes of a business then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any statutory consumer guarantees or legislation intended to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY OR INABILITY TO USE, OR RELIANCE ON, OUR SERVICES, AND BASED ON ANY TYPE OF LIABILITY INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTORY OR PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive officer of Mega Limited.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.<\/p> ","created_at":"2018-09-10

communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our

notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining

the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other

the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in

disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one

these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that

the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your

those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 21.5 a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury (unless applicable law says otherwise), that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n<\/p>\n<p> 22 We

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF

SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other

others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share,

should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original

the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import, or transfer any software or code supplied as part of your use of our services: (a) into any United States or New Zealand embargoed countries.\nor (b) to anyone listed as a specifically prohibited recipient by the United States Government or the New Zealand Government.\nBy using our websites and our services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.\nYou also will not use our websites or our services for any purpose prohibited by United States, New Zealand or any other law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

you with a warranty that the services will be without any faults, bugs or interruptions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 42 Whilst we intend that the services should be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is possible that on occasions our services may be unavailable to permit maintenance or other development activity to take place or be periodically interrupted for reasons outside our control.\n<\/p>\n<p> 43 Information provided on our services will change regularly.\nWe will try to keep the information up to date and correct, but again, we do not make any promises or guarantees about the accuracy of such information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 44 We do not warrant that the services will meet your requirements or that they will be suitable for any particular purpose.\n<\/p>\n<p> 45 You are the controller in respect of some data Mega holds about you and Mega is the processor, for GDPR purposes.\nMega is the controller in respect of some other data.\nSee our Privacy and Data Policy for more details.\nThese terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy are the contract between us that governs our processing of that data.\nIt is your sole responsibility to determine that the services meet the needs of you, your business or otherwise and are suitable for the purposes for which they are used.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46 We also aren't legally responsible for:

of any data that you upload, access or share.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46.4.2 content of ads appearing on our services (including links to advertisers' own websites) as the advertisers are responsible for the ads and we don't endorse the advertisers' products.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 46.4.3 content of other people's websites even if a link to their websites is included on our websites or our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 47 You warrant that if you are accessing and using the services for the purposes of a business then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any statutory consumer guarantees or legislation intended to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY OR INABILITY TO USE, OR RELIANCE ON, OUR SERVICES, AND BASED ON ANY TYPE OF LIABILITY INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTORY OR PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and

person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages

from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process

that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the

webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out

that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or

RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim

English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your

those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material including the exact URL link (with decryption key) to that material on Mega.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.4 your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address.\na statement by

if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.\nDetails of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in your account and/or by proceedings in New Zealand and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 25.5 we provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import,

provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF

measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive officer of Mega Limited.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.<\/p> ","created_at":"2018-09-10

Notices 63 Rights to Third Parties 64 Entire Agreement 65 Scope of these terms <p> 1 Welcome to Mega.\nMega Limited (“<b>Mega<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>”) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any ‘achievements’, ‘referral’ or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days’ notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement <\/p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14 You must: <\/p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n<\/p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: <\/p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or harass anyone, or to harm them as defined in the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 (NZ) or any similar law in any jurisdiction.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.4 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, unsuitable, offensive, obscene or discriminatory information of any kind.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.5 to run any network scanning software, spiders, spyware, robots, open relay software or similar software.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.6 to upload anything or otherwise introduce any spyware, viruses, worms, trojan horses, time bombs or bots or any other damaging items which could interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n<\/p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n<\/p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n<\/p> Intellectual Property Our IP <p> 17 You are not allowed to, and you can't let anyone else (including in particular any user within a business account of which you are administrator), use, copy, alter, distribute, display, licence, modify or reproduce, reverse assemble, reverse compile, communicate, share, transmit or otherwise make available, (whether digitally, electronically, by linking, or in hard copy or by any means whatsoever), any of our code, content, copyright materials, intellectual property or other rights without getting our permission in writing, other than in order to use our services as intended or as allowed under any open source licences under which we use intellectual property provided by others.\nThe open source code that we use, where we obtained it, and licences for that code, are all referenced on our websites and via our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 18 Without limiting any other provision of these terms, you are only permitted to directly and specifically use the API if you register at the developer registration page and agree that you may only publish or make available your application after we have approved it pursuant to our application approval process and licence agreement available on request at api@mega.nz <\/p> Your IP <p> 19 You own, or undertake that you are authorised to use, any intellectual property in any data you store on, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit or otherwise make available to or from, our systems or using our services.\nYou grant us a worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, store, back-up, copy, transmit, distribute, communicate, modify and otherwise make available, your data, solely for the purposes of enabling you and those you give access to, to use our services and for any other purpose related to provision of the services to you and them.\n<\/p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us.\nIf you believe that your content has been copied or used in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: <\/p>\n<p> 21.1 a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorised to act on their behalf.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.2 identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 21.3 identification of the material that is claimed to be

We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original

voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in New Zealand and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of New Zealand, as set out in these terms.\nWe may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n<\/p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at https://mega.nz/dispute or by email to copyright@mega.nz that includes substantially the following: <\/p>\n<p> 27.1 Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.2 Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the username of your Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.3 The statement: \"I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.4 The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.5 The statement \"I will accept service of proceedings in New Zealand or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Mega Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person.\".\n<\/p>\n<p> 27.6 A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email or using our webform will be accepted.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 27.7 Any comments you wish to provide.\n<\/p>\n<p> 28 We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.\nWe will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.\nSee also our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Suspension and Termination <p> 32 You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of our websites or the Settings section of our mobile apps.\nHowever, we will not provide any part-refund for any allowance not used on any subscription you may have, other than under clauses 4 and 58.\nIf you are a business account administrator you may also terminate access to any user within the business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33 We can immediately suspend or terminate your, and (as may be applicable) that of other users within a business account, access to our websites and our services without notice to you: <\/p>\n<p> 33.1 if you or they breach any of these terms or any other agreement you or they have with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.2 at any time if you are not a registered user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 33.3 if you are using a free account and that account has been inactive for over 3 months.\nor <\/p>\n<p> 33.4 if we have been unable to contact you using the email address in your account details.\n<\/p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in any regard as a result of any such actions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 36 All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.\n<\/p> Export Control <p> 37 You may not use, export, re-export, import, or transfer any software or code supplied as part of your use of our services: (a) into any United States or New Zealand embargoed countries.\nor (b) to anyone listed as a specifically prohibited recipient by the United States Government or the New Zealand Government.\nBy using our websites and our services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.\nYou also will not use our websites or our services for any purpose prohibited by United States, New Zealand or any other law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\n<\/p> Severability and Waiver <p> 38 If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n<\/p> Force Majeure <p> 39 We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a \"<b>Force Majeure Event<\/b>\").\nUpon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, we will be excused from any further performance of the obligations which are affected by that Force Majeure Event for so long as the event continues.\n<\/p> DISCLAIMERS <p> 40 WE DON'T GIVE YOU ANY WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING ABOUT THE SERVICES WHICH ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nTO AVOID DOUBT, ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUDED AS MUCH AS IS PERMITTED BY LAW, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PURPOSE, SAFETY, RELIABILITY, DURABILITY, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n<\/p>\n<p> 41 We will try to give you access to our services all the time, but we do not make any promises or provide you with a warranty that the services will be without any faults, bugs or interruptions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 42 Whilst we intend that the services should be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is possible that on occasions our services may be unavailable to permit maintenance or other development activity to take place or be periodically interrupted for reasons outside our control.\n<\/p>\n<p> 43 Information provided on our services will change regularly.\nWe will try to keep the information up to date and correct, but again, we do not make any promises or guarantees about the accuracy of such information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 44 We do not warrant that the services will meet your requirements or that they will be suitable for any particular purpose.\n<\/p>\n<p> 45 You are the controller in respect of some data Mega holds about you and Mega is the processor, for GDPR purposes.\nMega is the controller in respect of some other data.\nSee our Privacy and Data Policy for more details.\nThese terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy are the contract between us that governs our processing of that data.\nIt is your sole responsibility to determine that the services meet the needs of you, your business or otherwise and are suitable for the purposes for which they are used.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46 We also aren't legally responsible for: <\/p>\n<p> 46.1 any corruption or loss of data or other content which you or anyone else may experience after using our services or any problems you may have when you access our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46.2 devices or equipment that we do not own or have not given you.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46.3 any loss or damage if you do not follow our reasonable instructions, these terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 46.4 any actions or non-actions of other people which disrupt access to our services, including the <\/p>\n<p> 46.4.1 content and nature of any data that you upload, access or share.\n<\/p>\n<p> 46.4.2 content of ads appearing on our services (including links to advertisers' own websites) as the advertisers are responsible for the ads and we don't endorse the advertisers' products.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 46.4.3 content of other people's websites even if a link to their websites is included on our websites or our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 47 You warrant that if you are accessing and using the services for the purposes of a business then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any statutory consumer guarantees or legislation intended to protect non-business consumers in any jurisdiction (such as the Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 in New Zealand) do not apply to the supply of the services or these terms.\n<\/p> LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY BY YOU <p> 48 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE (THIS INCLUDES OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS AND AUTHORISED RESELLERS) ARE NOT LIABLE WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EQUITY OR ON ANY OTHER GROUNDS TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY TO PERSONS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR REVENUE, LOSS OF USE, LOST BUSINESS OR MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WASTED EXPENDITURE OR SAVINGS WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD, OCCURRING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE USE OR ABILITY OR INABILITY TO USE, OR RELIANCE ON, OUR SERVICES, AND BASED ON ANY TYPE OF LIABILITY INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTORY OR PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE.\n<\/p>\n<p> 49 YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS (INCLUDING ALL OUR LEGAL COSTS), EXPENSES, DEMANDS OR LIABILITY, DAMAGES AND LOSSES WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NEGLIGENCE), OR EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS OR ANY POLICY REFERENCED IN THESE TERMS.\n<\/p>\n<p> 50 IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO TERMINATE YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE CONTRACT YOU HAVE WITH US.\n<\/p>\n<p> 51 DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT OR OTHER COMPETENT AUTHORITY HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MOST RECENT SUBSCRIPTION AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US.\n<\/p> Disputes and Choice of Law <p> 52 Any and all disputes arising out of this agreement, its termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators’ and Mediators’ Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: <\/p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n<\/p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n<\/p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or provide you with notice we will email you at the email address you have recorded in your account details and such notices will be valid and deemed to be received by you whether or not you are using that address.\nWe may also send notices via any chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n<\/p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n<\/p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive officer of Mega Limited.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.<\/p> ","created_at":"2018-09-10

communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (“<b>UCE<\/b>”), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call “<b>data<\/b>” in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, “<b>services<\/b>” and each, a “<b>service<\/b>”).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (“<b>websites<\/b>”), using our mobile apps (“<b>mobile apps<\/b>”), our desktop apps (“<b>desktop apps<\/b>”), our command line tools (“<b>cmd tools<\/b>”), our browser extensions (“<b>browser extensions<\/b>”) and our application programming interface (“<b>API<\/b>”).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n<\/p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n<\/p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data<\/b>.\nEncryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n<\/p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or

notice.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n<\/p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: <\/p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original

the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n<\/p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n<\/p> Other Infringement Notices <p> 31 If you consider there has been some other

the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the greatest extent permitted at law, we will have no liability to you in

does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n<\/p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any

the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: <\/p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n<\/p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days’ notice to you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n<\/p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: <\/p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user’s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (“<b>excessive usage<\/b>”).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days’ notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n<\/p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n<\/p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n<\/p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n<\/p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else you give access to are also bound by our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\nBy accepting these terms, you also accept our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Notices <p> 63 You can contact us by sending an email to support@mega.nz.\nIf we need to contact you or

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such entities are located in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n<\/p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n<\/p> Mega’s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n<\/p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n<\/p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand law.\nSubject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, you, MEGA and all users, submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals and courts as further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n<\/p> Contact and complaints <p> 23 Questions and comments regarding this Policy are welcomed and should be addressed to the Privacy Officer at privacy@mega.nz.\nFor a comprehensive list of contact details for Mega Limited, and each of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, together with details of how to contact our privacy officer and data protection officer, see our contacts

supervisory authority on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Changes to our Policy <p> 24 We may make changes to this Policy in the future.\nAny changes will be notified to all users.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18

“<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such entities are located in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n<\/p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n<\/p> Mega’s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n<\/p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n<\/p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand law.\nSubject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, you, MEGA and all users, submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals and courts as further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n<\/p> Contact and complaints

information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n“<b>Personal information<\/b>” is the New Zealand term for “<b>personal data<\/b>” as defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (“<b>GDPR<\/b>”).\nThe term “<b>processing<\/b>” is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (“<b>MEGA<\/b>”, “<b>we<\/b>”, “<b>us<\/b>” or “<b>our<\/b>”) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:<\/b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (“<b>Terms<\/b>”) you authorise us to grant this access.\n<\/p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: <\/p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.2 The “<b>Your Files<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.3 The “<b>Your Chats<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.4 The “<b>Account Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.5 The “<b>Usage Data<\/b>” section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 4.6 The “<b>General<\/b>” section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n<\/p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (“<b>Your Files<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n<\/p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (“<b>Your Chats<\/b>”).\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you’re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (“<b>blob<\/b>”).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or “<b>personal information<\/b>” as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n<\/p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n<\/p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) <\/p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega’s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.<\/b>\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n<\/p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n<\/p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (“<b>Usage Data<\/b>”).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand <\/p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n<\/p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n<\/p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n<\/p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: <\/p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n<\/p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand <\/p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user’s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user’s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n<\/p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n<\/p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n<\/p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such entities are located in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n<\/p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n<\/p> Mega’s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n<\/p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n<\/p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n<\/p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n<\/p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand law.\nSubject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, you, MEGA and all users, submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals and courts as further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n<\/p> Contact and complaints <p> 23 Questions and comments regarding this Policy are welcomed and should be addressed to the Privacy Officer at privacy@mega.nz.\nFor a comprehensive list of contact details for Mega Limited, and each of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, together with details of how to contact our privacy officer and data protection officer, see our contacts page.\n<\/p>\n<p> 24 If you are in Europe or otherwise have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, you can find contact details for MEGA’s European Representative and European supervisory authority on our contacts page.\n<\/p> Changes to our Policy <p> 24 We may make changes to this Policy in the future.\nAny changes will be notified to all users.\n<\/p>\n<p>Last updated 18

browser cookies and all similar types of technologies (such as local storage, web beacons and device identifiers, which we talk more about below) as ‘Cookies’.\n<\/p>\n<p> In this Cookie Policy you can find out about the types of Cookies we use when you access our services and also what is done with the information collected from you via those Cookies.\nWe also explain how you can opt out of our use of Cookies where it is possible to do so.\n<\/p> Technologies We Use Browser Cookies <p> Browser cookies are small amounts of data that a website places on your computer or mobile device.\nThese browser cookies can be used to store information about the actions you take on the websites you visit, like the pages you’ve looked at and any preferences such as the language or screen layout that you’ve selected.\n<\/p>\n<p> Browser cookies and all the similar types of technologies we talk about further below, can identify your device, but they can’t identify you personally.\n<\/p>\n<p> Any browser cookies that we set when you visit our website or use our apps are called ‘first party cookies’ as we control them.\nHowever, when we use a browser cookie created by someone else (such as an advertising associate), it is referred to as a ‘third party cookie’ as we don’t control the data that is collected by that third party cookie.\n<\/p>\n<p> You can find out about the specific third party cookies we use by heading to the Third Party Cookies page in our Cookie Settings.\n<\/p>\n<p> On the Third Party Cookies page you can also find links to the privacy policy of each third party cookie that we use.\nThese specific third party privacy policies (and not this Cookie Policy or our Privacy and Data Policy) will govern how any information collected by those third party cookies is used.\n<\/p> Local Storage <p> Local storage works in a similar way to browser cookies.\nLocal storage consists of a small amount of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device.\nLocal storage has some technical advantages over browser cookies in terms of the amount of data it can store, how long it can exist for and the more efficient way it transmits information.\nLocal storage is also used in the same way as browser cookies for remembering things such as any preferences like the language or screen layout that you’ve selected.\n<\/p> Web Beacons <p> A web beacon is a tiny transparent image file placed on a webpage that can be used, often in conjunction with browser cookies, to track your visits to, and interaction with, the webpage.\nWeb beacons can also be used to track your journey across a website or a series of websites.\n<\/p>\n<p> When you open a page with a web beacon the small file is downloaded after sending a message to a remote computer across the internet where the original image is stored.\nThis message will include information such as your IP address and the time the web beacon was triggered.\nWeb beacons can be used to identify the elements of a webpage that you might have interacted with including specific adverts.\n<\/p>\n<p> Web beacons can also operate through a Beacon API to send tracking events such as page views directly to API servers.\n<\/p> Tracking URLs <p> These are specially formatted URLs that let us know when they have been clicked.\nThey help us track things like when a particular link in an email is clicked on or which option on a webpage is chosen more often.\n<\/p> Device Identifiers <p> When you access our services our system will generate a device ID (that doesn’t include the serial number, brand or model of your device) and assign this to our record of your device.\n<\/p>\n<p> We regard the use of device identifiers as being essential to offering you our services and therefore (as allowed by law) the use of device identifiers on our services cannot be turned off.\n<\/p> Cookie Categories <p> Based on the functionality they provide, we classify all the ‘Cookies’ we use (including browser cookies, local storage, web beacons, tracking URLs and device identifiers) into the following categories: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essential<\/li>\n<li>Preference<\/li>\n<li>Performance and Analytics<\/li>\n<li>Advertising<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> In our Cookie Settings you are able to select (with the exception of Essential Cookies as explained below) the categories of Cookies we can use whenever you access our services.\n<\/p> Essential Cookies <p> These are essential for providing you with important functionality and secure access to our services.\nWithout them, we couldn’t offer you the services we do.\nFor this reason, they do not require consent.\nWe use Essential Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> assist in securely connecting you to our services.\n<\/li>\n<li> ensure our technical infrastructure is operating efficiently in order to deliver our services to you in an optimal way.\n<\/li>\n<li> identify if you have previously requested the ‘remember me’ option so as to be automatically logged in when you return to use our services.\n<\/li>\n<li> determine if you have logged in and then keep you logged in for either the duration of your current session or for future visits as well if you have previously requested the ‘remember me’ option when logging in.\n<\/li>\n<li> identify and take action against malicious threats to our system.\n<\/li>\n<li> observe activity on our services and detect any actions which are against our Terms of Service or that may negatively impact on the quality of use of our services for other users.\nand <\/li>\n<li> assist you to make purchases from us.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Preference Cookies <p> These Cookies allow us to remember certain display and formatting settings you have chosen.\nNot accepting these Cookies will mean we won’t be able to remember some things for you such as your preferred screen layout.\nWe use Preference Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> remember the preferences you select for how various screens in our system should display (such as your Folder view in Cloud Drive) so that they can be displayed in the same way the next time you visit them.\nand <\/li>\n<li> remember the language you have chosen that you wish to use our services in.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Performance and Analytics Cookies <p> These Cookies help us to understand how you use our services and provide us data that we can utilise to make improvements.\nNot accepting these Cookies will mean we will have less data available to help make improvements.\nWe use Performance and Analytics Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> identify the parts of our services that you use more than others and how well different parts of our services function.\n<\/li>\n<li> observe the devices and settings you use when you access our services to help us to determine what improvements would be beneficial for us to make to our services.\nand <\/li>\n<li> monitor any changes we make to our services to see if they improve your user experience.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Advertising Cookies <p> These Cookies are used by us and our approved advertising partners to customise adverts which are shown by us on our services and by third parties on our services and on other websites and services.\nNot accepting these Cookies means you may be shown advertisements that are less relevant.\nWe and our approved advertising partners use Advertising Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> monitor how often you are displayed certain adverts.\n<\/li>\n<li> customise the adverts you see based on such things as your location and your actions on our services and the actions you have taken on other websites and services you have previously visited.\nand <\/li>\n<li> tell us when you click on a particular advert and then to track the following actions you take in response to that advert.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Managing Cookies <p> When you first access our services, you will be shown a brief message explaining what we use Cookies for.\nYou can either accept the use of all Cookies on our services, or if you do not wish to accept the use of some Cookies, you can go to our Cookie Settings to specify your preferences.\nThese preferences will be saved so that the next time you access our services you do not have to make your choices again.\nYou can also adjust the preferences you have selected at any time by accessing the Cookie Settings page again from the link in the footer of our website or from the Settings page in our mobile apps.\n<\/p>\n<p> Please note that if you choose to disable some or all Cookies in your browser, it will limit the functionality that different websites and services (including ours) can make available to you.\n<\/p> Related Terms <p> This Cookie Policy, our Terms of Service, our Privacy and Data Policy, and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in those documents, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nWhere there is any inconsistency between those documents, to the greatest extent at law, the Terms of Service prevail.\nAll defined terms in our Terms of Service shall have the same meaning in this Cookie Policy.\nTo the greatest extent permitted at law all limitations and exclusions of liability set out in our Terms of Service apply equally to this Cookie

used.\n<\/p> Local Storage <p> Local storage works in a similar way to browser cookies.\nLocal storage consists of a small amount of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device.\nLocal storage has some technical advantages over browser cookies in terms of the amount of data it can store, how long it can exist for and the more efficient way it transmits information.\nLocal storage is also used in the same way as browser cookies for remembering things such as any preferences like the language or screen layout that you’ve selected.\n<\/p> Web Beacons <p> A web beacon is a tiny transparent image file placed on a webpage that can be used, often in conjunction with browser cookies, to track your visits to, and interaction with, the webpage.\nWeb beacons can also be used to track your journey across a website or a series of websites.\n<\/p>\n<p> When you open a page with a web beacon the small file is downloaded after sending a message to a remote computer across the internet where the original image is stored.\nThis message will include information such as your IP address and the time the web beacon was triggered.\nWeb beacons can be used to identify the elements of a webpage that you might have interacted with including specific adverts.\n<\/p>\n<p> Web beacons can also operate through a Beacon API to send tracking events such as page views directly to API servers.\n<\/p> Tracking URLs <p> These are specially formatted URLs that let us know when they have been clicked.\nThey help us track things like when a particular link in an email is clicked on or which option on a webpage is chosen more often.\n<\/p> Device Identifiers <p> When you access our services our system will generate a device ID (that doesn’t include the serial number, brand or model of your device) and assign this to our record of your device.\n<\/p>\n<p> We regard the use of device identifiers as being essential to offering you our services and therefore (as allowed by law) the use of device identifiers on our services cannot be turned off.\n<\/p> Cookie Categories <p> Based on the functionality they provide, we classify all the ‘Cookies’ we use (including browser cookies, local storage, web beacons, tracking URLs and device identifiers) into the following categories: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essential<\/li>\n<li>Preference<\/li>\n<li>Performance and Analytics<\/li>\n<li>Advertising<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p> In our Cookie Settings you are able to select (with the exception of Essential Cookies as explained below) the categories of Cookies we can use whenever you access our services.\n<\/p> Essential Cookies <p> These are essential for providing you with important functionality and secure access to our services.\nWithout them, we couldn’t offer you the services we do.\nFor this reason, they do not require consent.\nWe use Essential Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> assist in securely connecting you to our services.\n<\/li>\n<li> ensure our

able to remember some things for you such as your preferred screen layout.\nWe use Preference Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> remember the preferences you select for how various screens in our system should display (such as your Folder view in Cloud Drive) so that they can be displayed in the same way the next time you visit them.\nand <\/li>\n<li> remember the language you have chosen that you wish to use our services in.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Performance and Analytics Cookies <p> These Cookies help us to understand how you use our services and provide us data that we can utilise to make

determine what improvements would be beneficial for us to make to our services.\nand <\/li>\n<li> monitor any changes we make to our services to see if they improve your user experience.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Advertising Cookies <p> These Cookies are used by us and our approved advertising partners to customise adverts which are shown by us on our services and by third parties

the use of all Cookies on our services, or if you do not wish to accept the use of some Cookies, you can go to our Cookie Settings to specify your preferences.\nThese preferences will be saved so that the next time you access our services you do not have to make your choices again.\nYou can also adjust the preferences you have selected at any time by accessing the Cookie Settings page again from

also used in the same way as browser cookies for remembering things such as any preferences like the language or screen layout that you’ve selected.\n<\/p> Web Beacons <p> A web beacon is a tiny transparent image file placed on a webpage that can be used, often in conjunction with browser cookies, to track your visits to, and interaction with, the webpage.\nWeb beacons can also be used to track your journey across a website or a series of websites.\n<\/p>\n<p> When you open a page with a web beacon the small file is downloaded after sending a message to a remote computer across the internet where the original image is stored.\nThis message will include information such as your IP address and the time the web beacon was triggered.\nWeb beacons can be used to identify the elements of a webpage that you might have interacted with including specific adverts.\n<\/p>\n<p> Web beacons can also operate through a Beacon API to send tracking events such as page views directly to API servers.\n<\/p> Tracking URLs <p> These are specially formatted URLs that let us know when they have been clicked.\nThey help us track things like when a particular link in an email is clicked on or which option on a webpage is chosen more often.\n<\/p> Device Identifiers <p> When you access our services our system will generate a device ID (that doesn’t include the serial number, brand or model of your device) and assign this to our record of your device.\n<\/p>\n<p> We regard the use of device identifiers as being essential to offering you our services and therefore (as allowed by law) the use of device identifiers on our services cannot be turned off.\n<\/p> Cookie Categories <p> Based on the functionality they provide, we classify all the ‘Cookies’ we use (including browser cookies, local storage, web beacons, tracking URLs and device identifiers) into the following categories: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essential<\/li>\n<li>Preference<\/li>\n<li>Performance and

able to remember some things for you such as your preferred screen layout.\nWe use Preference Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> remember the preferences you select for how various screens in our system

experience.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul> Advertising Cookies <p> These Cookies are used by us and our approved advertising partners to customise adverts which are shown by us on our services and by third parties on our services and on other websites and services.\nNot accepting these Cookies means you may be shown advertisements that are less relevant.\nWe and our approved advertising partners use Advertising Cookies to: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> monitor how often you are displayed certain adverts.\n<\/li>\n<li> customise the adverts you see based on such things as your location and your actions on our services
