software applications work, or work in a better, more efficient way.\nThey can do this because websites and software applications can read and write these files, enabling them to recognize you and

do.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Performance Cookies<\/strong> Performance cookies, which often include analytics cookies, collect information about your use of this Twitch Services and enable us to improve the way it works.\nFor example, performance cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the website, allow us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Twitch Services, help us record

third-party websites and services to understand their practices.<\/p>\n<p>If you connect to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application) through the Twitch

pages.\nYou can find out more about the specific Extension(s) operating on a given channel by clicking on the attribution links or icons that Twitch will make available on the channel page, for example, on the Twitch video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include

advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information.\nThese measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information.\nHowever, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure.\nWe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you.\nOnce you have asked us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law.<\/p> Children’s Privacy <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional information on their privacy practices.<\/p> Advertisers and Analytics Providers <p>Twitch may use third-party Web analytics services in connection with the Twitch Services.\nThese service providers

with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information.\nThese measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information.\nHowever, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure.\nWe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you.\nOnce you have asked us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law.<\/p> Children’s Privacy <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information <p>Please contact Twitch with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice at 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104 or by email to privacy@twitch.tv.\nWe will respond to your

third-party websites or services.\nThe privacy practices of those third parties are not governed by this Privacy Notice.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites and services to understand their practices.<\/p>\n<p>If you connect to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application) through the Twitch Services or otherwise link your Twitch account with a third-party service, you are requesting and authorizing us to share or grant access to information on your behalf (such as your username, the fact that your connection originated from the Twitch Services, and other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with such third party.\nWe may also send information about the content you watch or your activities on the Twitch Services to such third parties.\nFor example, we may make information available to app developers, game developers, and game publishers to facilitate purchases and awards of digital goods, such as games and in-game items.<\/p> Extensions <p>The Twitch Extensions program allows broadcasters to embed interactive, custom, third-party content and applications on their channel pages.\nYou can find out more about the specific Extension(s) operating on a given channel by clicking on the attribution links or icons that Twitch will make available on the channel page, for example, on the Twitch video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional information on their privacy practices.<\/p> Advertisers and Analytics Providers <p>Twitch may use third-party Web analytics services in connection with the Twitch Services.\nThese service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the Twitch Services.\nThe information collected (described above in “Automatically Collected Information”) may be shared with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information.\nThese measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information.\nHowever, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure.\nWe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you.\nOnce you have asked us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law.<\/p> Children’s Privacy <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information <p>Please contact Twitch with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice at 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104 or by email to privacy@twitch.tv.\nWe will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of its receipt.\nIf you are a California resident, you may have this same information emailed to you by sending a letter to the foregoing address with your email address and a

retention policies and applicable laws.\nAfter you close your account, Twitch will delete your personal information in a timely manner, provided however, if any personal information is required or permitted to be retained under applicable law or as necessary for Twitch’s legal and regulatory obligations, dispute resolution, community and site safety and security, and contract enforcement, such information will be retained for the period required for such purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Deletion of Personal Information&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When deleting personal information, Twitch will take standard commercially reasonable measures to make the personal information irrecoverable or irreproducible.\nThe specific manner of deletion will depend on the information being deleted and the type of Twitch

third-party websites or services.\nThe privacy practices of those third parties are not governed by this Privacy Notice.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites and services to understand their practices.<\/p>\n<p>If you connect to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application) through the Twitch Services or otherwise

as games and in-game items.<\/p> Extensions <p>The Twitch Extensions program allows broadcasters to embed interactive, custom, third-party content and applications on their channel pages.\nYou can find out more about the specific Extension(s) operating on a given channel by clicking on the attribution links or icons that Twitch will make available on the channel page, for example, on the Twitch video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional information on their privacy practices.<\/p> Advertisers and Analytics Providers <p>Twitch may use third-party Web analytics services in connection with the Twitch Services.\nThese service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the Twitch Services.\nThe information collected (described above in “Automatically Collected Information”) may be shared with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information.\nThese measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information.\nHowever, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure.\nWe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you.\nOnce you have asked us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law.<\/p> Children’s Privacy <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information <p>Please contact Twitch with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice at 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104 or by email to privacy@twitch.tv.\nWe will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of its receipt.\nIf you are a California resident, you may have this same information emailed to you by sending a letter to the foregoing address with your email address and a

third-party websites or services.\nThe privacy practices of those third parties are not governed by this Privacy Notice.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites

third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have

portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices

video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional

with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information.\nThese measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information.\nHowever, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure.\nWe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you.\nOnce you have asked us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law.<\/p> Children’s Privacy <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information <p>Please contact Twitch with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice at 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104 or by email to privacy@twitch.tv.\nWe will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of its receipt.\nIf you are a California resident, you may have this same information emailed to you by sending a letter to the foregoing address with your email address and a

find out more about the specific Extension(s) operating on a given channel by clicking on the attribution links or icons that Twitch will make available on the channel page, for example, on the Twitch video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional information on their privacy practices.<\/p> Advertisers and Analytics Providers <p>Twitch may use third-party Web analytics services in connection with the Twitch Services.\nThese service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the Twitch Services.\nThe information collected (described above in “Automatically Collected Information”) may be shared with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information.\nThese measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information.\nHowever, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure.\nWe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you.\nOnce you have asked us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law.<\/p> Children’s Privacy <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

this Cookie Policy, we refer to these technologies, which include cookies, pixels, web beacons, and gifs, collectively as “cookies.” This policy explains the different types of cookies used on the Twitch Services and how you can control them.\nWe may change this Cookie Policy at any time: please take a look at the “last modified” legend at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was

software applications work, or work in a better, more efficient way.\nThey can do this because websites and software applications can read and write these files, enabling them to recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website or software application more convenient (e.g., by remembering your user preferences).<\/p>\n<strong>What Cookies do we use?<\/strong>\n<p>Below we list the different types of cookies we may use on the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Essential Cookies<\/strong> These cookies are essential to the operation of the Twitch Services in order to enable you to move around it and to use its features.\nWithout these cookies, services you have asked for, such as accessing secure areas of the website or paid for content, cannot be provided.\nThese cookies are essential for using the website and therefore cannot be turned off without severely affecting your use of the website.<\/p>\n<p>Essential cookies on the Twitch Services may include:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookie Name<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Further information<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>_twitch_session_id<\/p>\n<p>Used to help users navigate within the website and to allow them to travel back to previous pages.\nYou can control these cookies via your browser setting but please note that the Twitch Services may not function smoothly if you do.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Performance Cookies<\/strong> Performance cookies, which often include analytics cookies, collect information about your use of this Twitch Services and enable us to improve the way it works.\nFor example, performance cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the website, allow us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Twitch Services, help us record any difficulties you have with the Twitch Services and show us whether our advertising is effective or not.<\/p>\n<p>Performance cookies on this Twitch Services may include:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookie

circumstances, we may use functionality cookies.\nFunctionality cookies allow us to remember the choices you make on the Twitch Services and to provide enhanced and more personalized features, such as customising a certain webpage, remembering if we have asked you to participate in a promotion and for other services you request, like watching a video or commenting on a blog.\nAll of these features help us to improve your visit to the Twitch Service.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Targeting or Advertising Cookies<\/strong> We and our service providers may use targeting or advertising cookies to deliver ads that we believe are more relevant to you and your interests.\nFor example, we may use targeting or advertising cookies to limit the number of times you see the same ad on our Twitch Services and to help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.\nThese cookies remember what you have looked at on the Twitch Services and we may share this information with other organizations, such as

situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation.\nTo improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as “Flash cookies”) are employed

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

third-party websites or services.\nThe privacy practices of those third parties are not governed by this Privacy Notice.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites and services to understand their practices.<\/p>\n<p>If you connect to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application) through the Twitch Services or otherwise link your Twitch account with a third-party service, you are requesting and authorizing us to share or grant access to information on your behalf (such as your username, the fact that your connection originated from the Twitch Services, and other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with such third party.\nWe may also send information about the content you watch or your activities on the Twitch Services to such third parties.\nFor example, we may make information available to app developers, game developers, and game publishers to facilitate purchases and awards of digital goods, such as games and in-game items.<\/p> Extensions <p>The Twitch Extensions program allows broadcasters to embed interactive, custom, third-party content and applications on their channel pages.\nYou can find out more about the specific Extension(s) operating on a given channel by clicking on the attribution links or icons that Twitch will make available on the channel page, for example, on the Twitch video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional information on their privacy practices.<\/p> Advertisers and Analytics Providers <p>Twitch may use third-party Web analytics services in connection with the Twitch Services.\nThese service providers

with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the

information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

would otherwise be available in court.\nAny dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.\nWhether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Twitch will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.<\/p>\n<p>(ii) If you are a resident in any jurisdiction in which the provision in the section above is found to be unenforceable, then any disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service will be governed by and construed under the laws

provision.\nAny waiver of any provision of these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by the relevant party.<\/p>\n<strong>b.\nSeverability<\/strong>\n<p>If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms of Service to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.<\/p>\n<strong>c.\nAssignment<\/strong>\n<p>These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

third-party websites or services.\nThe privacy practices of those third parties are not governed by this Privacy Notice.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites and services to understand their practices.<\/p>\n<p>If you connect to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application) through the Twitch Services or otherwise

Twitch Services to such third parties.\nFor example, we may make information available to app developers, game developers, and game publishers to facilitate purchases and awards of digital goods, such as games and in-game items.<\/p> Extensions <p>The Twitch Extensions program allows broadcasters to embed interactive, custom, third-party content and applications on their channel pages.\nYou can find out more about the specific Extension(s) operating on a given channel by clicking on the attribution links or icons that Twitch will make available on the channel page, for example, on the Twitch video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional information on their privacy practices.<\/p> Advertisers and Analytics Providers <p>Twitch may use third-party Web analytics services in connection with the Twitch Services.\nThese service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the Twitch Services.\nThe information collected (described above in “Automatically Collected Information”) may be shared with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information.\nThese measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information.\nHowever, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure.\nWe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you.\nOnce you have asked us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law.<\/p> Children’s Privacy <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information <p>Please contact Twitch with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice at 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104 or by email to privacy@twitch.tv.\nWe will respond to your

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should

promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have

information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information

promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or

information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices

laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

third-party websites or services.\nThe privacy practices of those third parties are not governed by this Privacy Notice.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites and services to understand their practices.<\/p>\n<p>If you connect to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application) through the Twitch Services or otherwise link your Twitch account with a third-party service, you are requesting and authorizing us to share or grant access to information on your behalf (such as your username, the fact that your connection originated from the Twitch Services, and other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with such third party.\nWe may also send information about the content you watch or your activities on the Twitch Services to such third parties.\nFor example, we may make information available to app developers, game developers, and game publishers to facilitate purchases and awards of digital goods, such as games and in-game items.<\/p> Extensions <p>The Twitch Extensions program allows broadcasters to embed interactive, custom, third-party content and applications on their channel pages.\nYou can find out more about the specific Extension(s) operating on a given channel by clicking on the attribution links or icons that Twitch will make available on the channel page, for example, on the Twitch video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional

with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie

serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links

that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the

promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or

information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information

third-party websites or services.\nThe privacy practices of those third parties are not governed by this Privacy Notice.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites and services to understand their practices.<\/p>\n<p>If you connect to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application) through the Twitch Services or otherwise link your Twitch account with a third-party service, you are requesting and authorizing us to share or grant access to information on your behalf (such as your username, the fact that your connection originated from the Twitch Services, and other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with such third party.\nWe may also send information about the content you watch or your activities on the Twitch Services to such third parties.\nFor example, we may make information available to app developers, game developers, and game publishers to facilitate purchases and awards of digital goods, such as games and in-game items.<\/p> Extensions <p>The Twitch Extensions program allows broadcasters to embed interactive, custom, third-party content and applications on their channel pages.\nYou can

video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only

our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should

our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should

that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those

third-party websites or services.\nThe privacy practices of those third parties are not governed by this Privacy Notice.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites and services to understand their practices.<\/p>\n<p>If you connect to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application) through the Twitch Services or otherwise

Twitch Services to such third parties.\nFor example, we may make information available to app developers, game developers, and game publishers to facilitate purchases and awards of digital goods, such as games and in-game items.<\/p> Extensions <p>The Twitch Extensions program allows broadcasters to embed interactive, custom, third-party content and applications on their channel pages.\nYou can find out more about the specific Extension(s) operating on a given channel by clicking on the attribution links or icons that Twitch will make available on the channel page, for example, on the Twitch video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional information on their privacy practices.<\/p> Advertisers and Analytics Providers <p>Twitch may use third-party Web analytics services in connection with the Twitch Services.\nThese service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the Twitch Services.\nThe information collected (described above in “Automatically Collected Information”) may be shared with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information.\nThese measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information.\nHowever, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure.\nWe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you.\nOnce you have asked us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law.<\/p> Children’s Privacy <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information <p>Please contact Twitch with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice at 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104 or by email to privacy@twitch.tv.\nWe will respond to your

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional

with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information.\nThese measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information.\nHowever, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure.\nWe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you.\nOnce you have asked us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law.<\/p> Children’s Privacy <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information <p>Please contact Twitch with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice at 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104 or by email to privacy@twitch.tv.\nWe will respond to your

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you

serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the

promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or

information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other

video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional

with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information.\nThese measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information.\nHowever, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure.\nWe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you.\nOnce you have asked us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law.<\/p> Children’s Privacy <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information <p>Please contact Twitch with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice at 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104 or by email to privacy@twitch.tv.\nWe will respond to your

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

Terms for Twitch Sings <p>Twitch Sings (“Twitch Sings”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a free-to-play singing game and streamer tool.\nIt allows anyone to sing rights-cleared music privately or live on their personal Twitch channel, and to create and share VODs with users of Twitch and other users of Twitch Sings.\nAll game activity can be streamed to Twitch without any additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates

analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie

that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the

ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is

Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the

deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information

account, depending on the service, you may be able to update your profile information and preferences or disable your account by logging in and going to the settings page -- for example, www.twitch.tv.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For other requests to review, update, delete, or otherwise limit Twitch’s use of information that you have provided directly to Twitch, you may contact privacy@twitch.tv.\nIn your request, please include your email address, name, address, and telephone number and specify all relevant background.\nTo protect your privacy and security, we may take steps to verify your identity before granting you access or making corrections to your information.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.<\/p>\n<p>Residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and residents of Brazil can exercise certain data subject rights available to them under applicable data protection laws.&nbsp.\nWe will comply with requests to exercise these rights in accordance with applicable law.\nPlease note that in some circumstances, we may need to keep processing your information for certain legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation.&nbsp.\nIf these rights apply to you, they may permit you to request that we:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obtain access to or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you.<\/li>\n<li>Prevent the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes (including any direct marketing processing based on profiling).<\/li>\n<li>Update personal information that is out of date or incorrect.<\/li>\n<li>Delete certain personal information we hold about you.<\/li>\n<li>Restrict the way that we process and disclose specific personal information about you.<\/li>\n<li>Transfer your personal information to a third-party provider of services.<\/li>\n<li>Revoke consent that you previously provided for the processing of your personal information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more information on how to exercise these rights, click here.&nbsp.\nIf applicable, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country where you are based.\nAlternatively, you may seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been breached.<\/p> Account Closure &amp.\nDeletion <p>If you would like to close your account and delete your profile information on www.twitch.tv go to https://www.twitch.tv/user/delete_account.\nFor Twitch Services other than twitch.tv, you may update or delete information tied to your account, or close an account, by accessing the “My Account” area of the service or by submitting a help ticket to that service.\nIf you close your account, Twitch may retain certain information about you for the activities described in this Privacy Notice, or as permitted or required by applicable law.<\/p> Third-Party Services and Websites <p>The Twitch Services may link to third-party websites or services.\nThe privacy practices of those third parties are not governed by this Privacy Notice.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites and services to understand their practices.<\/p>\n<p>If you connect to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application) through the Twitch Services or otherwise link your Twitch account with a third-party service, you are requesting and authorizing us to share or grant access to information on your behalf (such as your username, the fact that your connection originated from the Twitch Services, and other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with such third party.\nWe may also send information about the content you watch or your activities on the Twitch Services to such third parties.\nFor example, we may make information available to app developers, game developers, and game publishers to facilitate purchases and awards of digital goods, such as games and in-game items.<\/p> Extensions <p>The Twitch Extensions program allows broadcasters to embed interactive, custom, third-party content and applications on their channel pages.\nYou can find out more about the specific Extension(s) operating on a given channel by clicking on the attribution links or icons that Twitch will make available on the channel page, for example, on the Twitch video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction by a viewer with an Extension or with the channel on which the Extension is activated will provide the developer that operates the Extension with viewer information of the nature described above in “Automatically Collected Information.” Twitch does not provide access to your user name or ID to third-party Extension developers as part of the Twitch Extensions program unless you click “Grant Access” within the Extension or you install an Extension on your channel.\nYou are responsible for any information you provide to the developer independently, for example, through a web form on the Extension or visiting that developer’s website.<\/p>\n<p>We require Extension developers to process data about you only for the purposes set forth in our developer agreement.\nWe encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail page to review any privacy policy posted by the developer, which may include additional information on their privacy practices.<\/p> Advertisers and Analytics Providers <p>Twitch may use third-party Web analytics services in connection with the Twitch Services.\nThese service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the Twitch Services.\nThe information collected (described above in “Automatically Collected Information”) may be shared with or collected directly by these services and processed to evaluate your use of the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch may also work with third-party ad networks, advertisers, and advertising analytics providers to target (and measure the performance of) ads to you both on and off the Twitch Services.\nWe may share with these third parties (or they may directly collect) data such as cookie and mobile ad identifiers in order to engage in advertising activity (including to understand how you respond to advertisements and to serve relevant ads).\nTwitch also works with third parties to serve ads to you off Twitch’s Services.\nWhen we do so, we may share information such as your email address or resettable device identifier for that advertising partner to “match” to other information that may have about you.<\/p>\n<p>Advertisers on Twitch, or representatives or service providers working on their behalf (“Twitch Advertisers”), sometimes use technology to serve ads that appear on our services directly to your device.&nbsp.\nThey automatically receive certain data, such as your IP address, when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies (or similar technologies) to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.\nThis Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of Twitch Advertisers and you should consult their respective privacy policies.\nFor more information about Twitch Advertisers and similar entities that use these technologies, and to opt-out of their advertising practices, go to our Privacy Choices page.<\/p> Do Not Track <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative, Your Online Choices and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above.\nHowever, Twitch does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.<\/p> Data Security <p>Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information.\nThese measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information.\nHowever, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure.\nWe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk.\nWe cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<\/p> Retention of Your Information <p>Twitch maintains data related to your usage of Twitch for as long as it is required in order to fulfill the relevant purposes described in this Privacy Notice, as may be required (or permitted) by law such as for tax and accounting purposes, or as otherwise communicated to you.\nOnce you have asked us to close your account and delete your profile information, we will delete all information that we are not required or permitted to retain by law.<\/p> Children’s Privacy <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from persons under 13 years-of-age.\nIf Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13 has been collected on or through the Twitch Services, Twitch will take appropriate steps to delete this information.<\/p>\n<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Services member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and personal information deleted.<\/p>\n<p>For residents of the EEA and residents of Brazil where the processing of personal information is based on consent, Twitch will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.<\/p> Merger or Sale <p>In the event that Twitch, or some or all assets related to the Twitch Services are acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or in connection with a contemplated change of ownership transaction, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control event, including in the course of diligence.<\/p> International Data Transfers <p>Information collected by Twitch may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States (for instance in our major data centers), or in any other country where Twitch or its affiliates, subsidiaries, partners, or service providers are located or maintain facilities.&nbsp.\nIf we provide any information about you to any such entities, we will take appropriate measures to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable law.<\/p> Changes and Updates to This Privacy Notice <p>Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Services or to reflect changes in the law).\nPlease check this Privacy Notice periodically for those changes.\nYour continued use of the Twitch Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes.<\/p>\n<p>We will not materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of personal information collected in the past under a prior version of the Privacy Notice without the consent of affected individuals<\/p> Twitch Contact Information <p>Please contact Twitch with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice at 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104 or by email to privacy@twitch.tv.\nWe will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of its receipt.\nIf you are a California resident, you may have this same information emailed to you by sending a letter to the foregoing address with your email address and a request for this information.<\/p>\n<p>For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation, Twitch UK Limited has been designated by Twitch Interactive, Inc.\nas its representative in the EU to act on its behalf with regard to its obligations under Article 27 of the General Data Protection Regulation.\nPlease contact Twitch UK with any questions (including questions about your rights) or

regulatory obligations, dispute resolution, community and site safety and security, and contract enforcement.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch will delete your personal information in accordance with Twitch’s data retention policies and applicable laws.\nAfter you close your account, Twitch will delete your personal information in a timely manner, provided however, if any personal information is required or permitted to be retained under applicable law or as necessary for Twitch’s legal and regulatory obligations, dispute resolution, community and site safety and security, and contract enforcement, such information will be retained for the period required for such purposes.<\/p>\n<p>Deletion of Personal Information&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When deleting personal information, Twitch will take standard commercially reasonable measures to make the personal information irrecoverable or irreproducible.\nThe specific manner of deletion will depend on the information being deleted and the type of Twitch

impossible or renders the data no longer personally identifiable.\nNon-electronic documents or files containing personal information will be shredded, incinerated or both.<\/p> About Careers Blog

software applications work, or work in a better, more efficient way.\nThey can do this because websites and software applications can read and write these files, enabling them to recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website or software application more convenient (e.g., by remembering your user preferences).<\/p>\n<strong>What Cookies do we use?<\/strong>\n<p>Below we list the different types of cookies we may use on the Twitch Services.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Essential Cookies<\/strong> These cookies are essential to the operation of the Twitch Services in order to enable you to move around it and to use its features.\nWithout these cookies, services you have asked for, such as accessing secure areas of the website or paid for

do.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Performance Cookies<\/strong> Performance cookies, which often include analytics cookies, collect information about your use of this Twitch Services and enable us to improve the way it works.\nFor example, performance cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on the website, allow us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Twitch Services, help us record any difficulties you have with the Twitch Services and show us whether our advertising is effective or not.<\/p>\n<p>Performance cookies on this Twitch Services may include:<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookie

help us to improve your visit to the Twitch Service.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Targeting or Advertising Cookies<\/strong> We and our service providers may use targeting or advertising cookies to deliver ads that we believe are more relevant to you and your interests.\nFor example, we may use targeting or advertising cookies to limit the number of times you see the same ad on our Twitch Services and to help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.\nThese cookies remember what you have looked at on the Twitch Services and we may share this information with other organizations, such as

additional software.<\/p>\n<p>Sing a song start to finish, perform a duet, or go live within a concert setting to hundreds of cheering fans.&nbsp.\nBonus: if you use the Twitch Sings feature that allows you to live stream your performance to Twitch, emotes from chat will rise from the audience, while follows, cheers and subscription notices are highlighted with alerts and in-concert effects.<\/p>\n<p>Before you stage dive on top of screaming fans, several guidelines:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sing the song lyrics as displayed in the app or, when song lyrics are not displayed, to the best of your knowledge;<\/li>\n<li>Avoid altering the fundamental character of any song included in Twitch Sings.\nand<\/li>\n<li>Behave (in rock parlance: don’t trash the hotel room).&nbsp.\nConduct yourself in accordance with the Community Guidelines and these Terms of Service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make available musical works from a variety of artists within Twitch Sings (from rock to pop), Twitch negotiated licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new musical tracks.&nbsp.\nThe licenses granted to Twitch allow Twitch to use the works, and offer them to you for use, solely in connection with Twitch Sings and the Twitch Services.\nTwitch Sings content has not been cleared for use outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that, in your new rock-n-roll lifestyle, do not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>make unauthorized use of the copyrighted elements of a Twitch Sings song (including the use of the story of a song in another creative work);<\/li>\n<li>assert copyright ownership of the songs (or any arrangements of the songs) provided in Twitch Sings.\nor<\/li>\n<li>use your performance from Twitch Sings outside the Twitch Services, with the exception that you can use the YouTube exporter tool offered on Twitch.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may not exercise any rights to claim or monetize any exported content, or block, dispute, interfere with, or suppress any attempts by a music rights holder (such as a music publisher who controls the song you recorded) to claim or monetize the exported content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.&nbsp.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Twitch Sings at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nThis may mean that Twitch will be required to take down previously recorded performances.\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Twitch Sings.<\/p> 19.\nSpecific Terms for Soundtrack by Twitch <p>Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), which is part of the Twitch Services, is a streamer tool designed to give creators the ability to play licensed music in the background of their live streams and upload on-demand videos of those live streams that do not include such music.\nBy downloading, installing, and/or otherwise using Soundtrack, you agree that your download, installation, and/or use of Soundtrack will be governed by these Terms of Service.\nTwitch’s Community Guidelines and Music Guidelines apply as well, and we recommend that you review both resources prior to using Soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>Soundtrack was borne out of Twitch’s desire to offer creators a wide variety of licensed music for live streaming.\nTo make this possible, Twitch secured licenses with many different rights holders and continues to do so in order to add new tracks to Soundtrack’s stations and playlists.\nTwitch also designed Soundtrack to give creators the ability to generate on-demand videos of their live streams that do not include this music.<\/p>\n<p>The licenses Twitch secured allow Twitch to make these materials available to you for your use in live streams on your Twitch channel.\nMusic and other materials made available through Soundtrack have not been licensed for your use in pre-recorded content, in content that can be streamed on-demand (such as VODs and Clips), or outside the Twitch Services.\nWhat this means is that you may not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create on-demand content containing materials from Soundtrack -- we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside the Twitch Services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing any of the above may subject you to a notice of alleged infringement from rights holders and their agents.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we want to alert you to the fact that music rights tend to evolve over time.\nThus, we reserve the right to modify or remove certain songs or other content from Soundtrack at any time (for example, as necessary to comply with our music licenses or with applicable laws).\nTwitch takes no responsibility and assumes no liability in connection with your use of Soundtrack.<\/p> About Careers Blog Press Brand Developers Platforms Prime Bits Extensions Advertise Gift Card Terms of service Privacy Notice Ad Choices Cookie Policy Partners Affiliates
