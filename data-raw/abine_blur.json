This Privacy Policy describes how we deal with your personal information if you visit abine.com or use Blur.\nThis Privacy Policy does not address DeleteMe, joindeleteme.com, or other Abine products, services, or websites.\nYou can learn more about how we use and protect DeleteMe, joindeleteme.com, or other Abine products, services, or websites in the joindeleteme.com Privacy Policy or by contacting us.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>We never sell your data.\nPeriod.<\/strong> If we share your data, it's only with companies we've hired to do work for us to carry out the services you want.\nThey'll never own it or be able to share it with anyone else.\nYour data is yours.\nWe do sometimes place online advertisements or pay affiliate partners for subscription sales they generate.\nThese systems may use IP address or order numbers to identity and record these sales.\nWe do not share information beyond what is needed for these transactions, but some of these companies may already be tracking you outside of our control (for instance by clicking on a google search result).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Philosophy.<\/strong> We're dedicated to consumer privacy rights and support privacy policies that are understandable.\nWe're committed to responsibly handling any information we collect.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data use.<\/strong> Many companies profit off their users by selling their information, but we'll never do that.\nWe only use the data we collect about the way people use our products and our website to build better products.\nWe'll never share any personal data about your online activity or use it to target you individually.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data sharing.<\/strong> A few things that you do may require us to share data.\nFor instance, when you buy one of our products with your credit card, we have to share that info to process the payment.\nWe try to do things ourselves but sometimes need to rely on external companies.\nWe make hard decisions about when to do so, always balancing the privacy risks against the benefits.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Law enforcement.<\/strong> We won't provide your information unless we're compelled by law through a valid court order, which is a much higher standard than the usual \"permitted by law\" standard.\nCompanies don't have to tell you when someone requests your data, but we will try and inform you, if we are legally allowed to do so, so you can be aware and take legal action if you choose.\n<\/p>\n<p> As of today, Abine has <strong>not<\/strong> received a national security order and we have not been required by a FISA court to keep any secrets.\n<\/p>\n<p> Except as required by law, Abine, Inc.\n<strong>will not share your data with third parties;<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p> Abine Inc.\nwill only retain user information for a maximum of <strong>6 months after a user has canceled a paid subscription<\/strong> (except for basic information that the transaction occurred), <b>and is no longer using our free service<\/b>, except for any payment-related information that we have to retain for fraud purposes.\n<\/p> Abine.com Website Privacy Policy <p> Abine Inc.'s goal is to help you regain control of your personal information online, and as such, we do not use tracking to collect any personal information on our abine.com website.\nOur privacy policy reflects this goal.\n<\/p>\n<p> We do not use persistent cookies generally on this site.\n<em>The only time we use a persistent (i.e., non-session) cookie is when we deliver your download to you<\/em>.\n<strong>We delete the cookie right after installation.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p> We log aggregate information about our site visitors, but it does not contain your name, Email, or other personally-identifiable information.\nThese logs are automatically generated for all websites and are not powered by online trackers.\n<\/p>\n<p> We may use session cookies from time to time.\nSession cookies expire when you close your browser.\nYou can set your browser to refuse cookies by following the instructions provided by your web browser.\n<\/p>\n<p> We won't share your data unless you are using specific services through us that require it or if we are ever compelled by legal orders, in which cases, we will share the minimum data required.\n<\/p>\n<p> We do not collect any personal information through the abine.com website.\nEven so, abine.com is not directed at individuals under 13 years of age in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).\n<\/p>\n<p> If you choose to sign up for our newsletters or to receive emailed updates of our privacy blog, we'll occasionally send you emails with coupons, announcements, and Abine news.\n<\/p>\n<p> We will sometimes link to other websites.\nYou should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party sites before using them.\nOur privacy policy does not apply to these other websites, and we cannot control their activities.\n<\/p> Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) &amp.\nBlur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile) Privacy Policy <p> Abine Inc.\nbuilt Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) &amp.\nBlur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile) around the principle of letting users protect their privacy, so <strong>Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile do not try and track your personal data<\/strong>.\nThey have a limited ability to collect data about what sites you visit and web behavior such as what forms you interact with (or we autofill), but we only use this anonymized data to improve our form detection and filling capabilities.\n<\/p>\n<p> By default, Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) &amp.\nBlur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile) do not communicate with our servers except: 1) when getting new tracker-blocking rules or software versions, 2) obtaining updates to our form detection, 3) sending back form telemetry, such as form metadata, autofilled metrics, and any user-created crowdsourced form mappings.\nThe information sent to our servers is explicitly not tied to your account or other personal information.\n<strong>You can also opt-out of this kind of data collection in the application's settings<\/strong>.\n<\/p>\n<p> There are a few limited pieces of information we need to know to make sound decisions about the business from Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Information about your install of Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile<\/strong>, such as where you downloaded it, the original version you installed, the current version you have, and the month of your original install.\n<\/li>\n<li> Because there is a different version of Blur for each browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, IE), <strong>we know how many installs there have been for each browser<\/strong>.\n<\/li>\n<li> On a daily basis, <strong>we know how many users we have of Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile and whether those users are based in or outside the US<\/strong>.\n<\/li>\n<li> In order to improve our form detection capabilities, when you interact with forms <strong>we capture pieces of form meta-data and metrics<\/strong> such as if what we auto-filled into a form was then corrected by you.\nThis data collection is anonymized and explicitly not tied to your account information, and not received in real-time, only once a day.\n<\/li>\n<li> Lastly, <strong>we know how many visits to abine.com come from the Blur tool<\/strong>, but we do not know if any given add-on user clicked anything or other personal details.\n<\/li>\n<li> If you choose to interact with Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile to send us feedback, we may receive the following additional information that doesn't identify you: <strong>The description of the problem that you submit to us<\/strong> and <strong>the website URL and any trackers found on it<\/strong>.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p> All of your personal Masked Email, Masked Phone, and Masked Card data is encrypted using industry standard 256-bit AES encryption.\nThe information is accessed by the client in real time when the information is needed.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you're using Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile Premium, we use specialty companies to process payments and phone calls and texts.\nThese service providers will have access to some of your data only to process it, but they'll never own it or share it with anyone else.\n<\/p> MaskMe &amp.\nMaskMe Mobile Privacy Policy <p> All of your accounts, passwords, and other browsing activity is stored locally in an encrypted database that we do not have the ability to decrypt.\nIt's encrypted using industry standard <strong>256-bit AES encryption<\/strong>.\nIf you choose to use the Sync feature to access your MaskMe data from any device, that means we're storing that data in an encrypted form on our servers - we can't read your passwords or see your accounts.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you're using MaskMe Premium, we use specialty companies to process payments and phone calls and texts.\nThese service providers will have access to some of your data only to process it, but they'll never own or share it with anyone else.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at legal@getabine.com.\n<\/p> Blur &amp.\nMaskMe user data privacy chart: <p>Your privacy is our business, so we spend a lot of time making sure that we collect the minimum information necessary to operate and responsibly handle all information we do store.\nWe think it’s important to be transparent with where, how, and why we need this data to operate Blur and MaskMe and how we store it.<\/p> The type of information <strong>If you're using this feature of ...<\/strong>\n<strong>Your personal email address (optional)<\/strong> Abine has it because you have an account with us, and it lets us

only you can read the labels, but stored on Abine's servers.\nPlus any websites that you gave a Masked Email will have it.\n<strong>Senders of messages to your Masked Emails<\/strong> We know this information in order to let you reply without giving your real email address.\n<strong>Content of messages sent to your Masked Emails<\/strong> Your messages are forwarded to your real inbox.\nThey are temporarily cached in your Masked Inbox for less than 24 hours (by default), then permanently deleted from our servers.\n<strong>Your Blur &amp.\nMaskMe password (optional)<\/strong> Only you know it.\nAbine never knows your Master Password and even when we synchronize your data across \"the cloud\" it's all encrypted in a way we can't decrypt.\n<strong>Your logins and account information

them through their interface.\n<strong>Who has charged your Masked Cards (merchants)<\/strong> We can see the merchant that charged your Masked Card (which doesn't always indicate the actual website).\nYour credit/debit card bill will show charges from \"ABINE\" (or) \"BLUR\" and not the actual merchant.\nOur bank partner can see who charged your Masked Card, but it is anonymous (in no

ARBITRATION<\/i>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Here are the ground rules if you're using Masked Cards<\/strong>.\nThe following Terms of Service (“Terms,” “Agreement”) govern your use of MaskMe Premium's Masked Cards (\"Masked Card Solutions\",\"Masked Cards,” “the service”), a product of Abine, Inc.\n(“us,” “we”).\nThese Terms describe the terms and conditions on which Abine provides Masked Cards to you.\nFor more information about how our products and services work, please visit www.abine.com/support.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal policies can be tedious, but please read up<\/strong>.\nWe'll strive to make our policies understandable.\nREAD THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.\nIF YOU USE MASKED CARDS, YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITH ABINE.\nTHIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT.\nIf you don't agree to these terms and conditions, you aren't permitted to use Masked Cards.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Things could change<\/strong>.\nWe may amend or terminate any terms of this Agreement at any time, and that amendment or termination will be effective at the time we post the revised terms on the site.\nYou can tell when we last revised this agreement was by looking at the “last revised” date at the top of this Agreement.\nYour continued use of Masked Cards after we've posted revised terms signifies your acceptance of the revised terms.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>How Masked Cards work<\/strong>.\n.\nMasked Card Solutions let you shop online more safely by letting you (\"user\" or \"you\") access and facilitate a payment using Masked Cards exclusively with the MCS software: a browser add-on and a web/mobile application.\nYou obtain access to the Masked Cards features by registering to use one of our “Masked Card Solutions” and, typically, fees are charged to the personal credit card you provide upon signup (your “Personal Credit Card”) or other Funding Sources you may have added.\nWhen you're shopping online at a retailer (“retailer,” “merchant”), you can choose to pay for products or services with a Masked Card during checkout by specifying the monetary amount of your purchase.\nThe Funding Source associated with your account will be charged the amount you specify.\nThe retailer will see only the Masked Credit Card number.<\/p>\n<p>You can view transaction details for all your Masked Cards from within MCS products such as Blur &amp.\nMaskMe by clicking on the Masked Cards icon, then clicking “view details” next to the Masked Card you wish to examine.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Key characteristics of Masked Cards<\/strong>.\nYou're buying the right to access Abine's credit line in the amount you specify for the Masked Cards you create.\nAs such, you'll see “Abine, Inc.” listed on your Personal Credit Card statement as the merchant, even though you'll spend the Masked Cards at other retailers.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Masked Cards need to be at least $10 in value, but no more than $500.<\/strong> They are assigned an expiration date when you create them.\nMasked Cards you create are issued by our bank partner as MasterCard numbers.\nMasked Cards are usable until their balance reaches zero, they expire, or you deactivate them.\nAbine reserves the right to change limits globally or for specific uses at any time and for any reason including suspicious activity.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Who gets your Personal Credit Card<\/strong>.\nWhen you use a Masked Card to purchase something from a merchant, that merchant will not see or have access to your Personal Credit Card.\nAbine uses a payments processor to process payments.\nWhen you sign up for one of our Masked Card Services or add money to a Masked Card, you're billed through our payment processor.\nOur payments processor stores or has access to your Personal Credit Card, but Abine, our bank partner, and MasterCard do not.<\/p>\n<p>For more details about the privacy of your personal information when you use Abine products, services, or websites, please visit our privacy policy at www.abine.com/legal.html.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Credit card authorizations<\/strong>.\nAs soon as the merchant where you use a Masked Card runs an authorization, that money is held on your Masked Card and can't be used (it will show up as \"pending\" to you when you view transaction details on a Masked Card).\nFor some authorizations, merchants might add an additional percentage hold on top of the purchase value (for example, 20% for a restaurant).<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>ACH Authorization<\/strong>.\nWhen you use your bank account as your Payment Method for any transaction or to fund Masked Cards, you are requesting an electronic transfer from your bank account.\nFor these transactions, Abine will make electronic transfers via ACH from your bank account in the amount specified by your or Abine (in the case of subscription payments).\nYou agree that such requests constitute your authorization to Abine.\nto make the transfers.\nOnce you have provided your authorization for the transfer, you will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Chargebacks and disputes with merchants<\/strong>.\nYou understand and agree that Abine is not responsible for the goods or services that you pay for using a Masked Card.\nEach seller that you purchase from is responsible for providing the goods and services that you purchase and for providing all customer service related to those goods and services.\nWe recommend that you review a seller's policies before completing your purchase.\nYou are responsible for resolving any disputes that you may have with a seller.\nIf you have exhausted all options for resolving a dispute with a seller, you may choose to file a dispute through Abine (see “How to file a Dispute” below).<\/p>\n<p>Disputing a charge from Abine on your bank statement that is related to a Masked Card purchase is filing a dispute against Abine, Inc.\nand will not only damage your relationship with Abine, but will not resolve any dispute with the seller of the item purchased with a Masked Card.\nAbine is the “issuing bank” for purchases completed with a Masked Card.\nIf you file a Chargeback against Abine that Abine contests and wins (i.e.\nyou lose the Chargeback) you will be charged a $25 chargeback processing fee.\nThere is no chargeback processing fee if you win a contested Chargeback.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Release of Abine, Inc.<\/strong> By filing a Dispute, you understand and agree that: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are asking Abine to assist in resolving the dispute in its sole discretion and that such assistance or Abine's decision may not be satisfactory to you.\n<\/li>\n<li>Abine's assistance in resolving the dispute does not guarantee any particular outcome nor any action on Abine's part.\nand <\/li>\n<li>You release Abine and our officers, directors, agents, employees, and suppliers from all claims, demands, and damages of any kind arising out of your dispute with a seller and Abine's review of your Dispute.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>How to file a Dispute<\/strong>.\nTo file a Dispute, follow these steps: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within 60 days of the original transaction, email blur-support@abine.com with the following information: <\/li>\n<li>The last 4 digits of the Masked Card used for the related purchase.<\/li>\n<li>The name of the merchant/seller involved.<\/li>\n<li>A

resolve the issue and copies of supporting documentation (such as email correspondence, receipts, shipping confirmations, etc.) <\/li>\n<li>Provide any additional information or documentation that we may request.\nOnce Abine has decided the outcome of the Dispute, the parties will be notified of the decision.\nYou are required to comply with the decision and complete any actions required by such decision.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>We can restrict or block the use of your Masked Cards for any reason<\/strong>.\nWe reserve the right to block or limit transactions at any time for security or fraud reasons without prior notice to you.\nUnder these circumstances, we'll fully refund any money remaining on the Masked Card in question, after any outstanding transactions have

activity presents risk or security concerns, or if we are unable to verify your identity, we may take actions to protect Abine, Inc.\nand our users, our Financial Institution Partners, or other third parties from Reversals, claims, fines, penalties, and any other liability.\nThese actions may include, but are not limited to, the following: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suspending your access to your Account

use a Masked Card for recurring charges, like a subscription.\nFor recurring charges, it's your responsibility to ensure that there is enough value and time expiration on the Masked Card you're using.\nWe are not liable if the Masked Card gets declined and you lose access to a recurring service.\nWe aren't responsible for any late fees, service terminations, or other problems that arise because of declined transactions.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Authorization to recover amounts due<\/strong>.\nIf a Masked Card is overdrawn (i.e.\nthe total amount of any transactions posted to a Masked Card is greater than the original Masked Card value), or the charge to fund a successfully used Masked Card fails to process, you authorize Abine and our Financial Institution Partners to take any of the following actions to recover the remaining amounts from you: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debit the credit/debit card or bank account linked to your paid subscription.<\/li>\n<li>Debit any of your other Masked Cards with a remaining balance<\/li>\n<li>Suspend your paid subscription and require your immediate payment.\nor<\/li>\n<li>Engage in collection efforts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>In the case of an ACH transaction that fails to process, you may be subject to the actions detailed above, plus an additional $25.00 bounced check fee.\nUsers can pay via another ACH transfer, or place a credit card on file to pay off the balance more quickly.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>You cannot sell or transfer a Masked Card to anyone else<\/strong>.\nA Masked Card can only be used by you or someone you authorize.\nIf you authorize anyone else to use a Masked Card you create, you are responsible for all transactions made by that person.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Reporting lost or stolen Masked Cards<\/strong>.\nYou should immediately deactivate a compromised Masked Card within Blur, or another Masked Card Solution.\nTo do so, login, click on the Masked Cards icon, locate the compromised card in the list of cards you've

or theft.\nYou can reach us by phone at 800-928-1987 or by email at reportlostcard@abine.com or through our www.abine.com/support support page.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>The cost of using Masked Cards Services<\/strong>.\nMasked Cards typically require a subscription to a Masked Card Service operated by Abine.\n(Currently this is a $39 annual/$59 biennial/$79 triennial fee for Blur plus the cost of any purchases you make using a Masked Card.) Any time you make a purchase with a Masked Card by inputting the monetary value of that purchase, you're authorizing Abine to charge your Funding Method in that amount.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>There may be a charge to create a Masked Card.<\/strong> If you are using a Credit Card as the Funding Source for your Masked Card then you may incur a service fee beyond that of the Masked Card amount.\nService Fees per the Schedule of Fees will be charged to the same Funding Source as was used to create the Masked Card or to any other Funding Source you might have.\nFees can be changed at any time.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Open Masked Cards will incur a Monthly Fee.<\/strong> After 30 days from the date the Masked Card was created, Masked Card you have that is open with a remaining balance will be charged a service fee (see below for current fees).\nThis will not be charged to your Funding Source, but will instead be withdrawn from remaining balance of the related Masked Card.\nIf there is an insufficient amount on the Masked Card to cover the monthly fee, it will be charged the remaining balance and the Masked Card will be closed.\nIf a Masked Card is used for a successful transaction within the 30 day period, it will not incur this monthly fee.<\/p>\n<strong>Schedule of Fees<\/strong> Fee Using a Personal Credit Card as a Funding Source $2 per card for cards under $100.\nAn additional 1.5% of the Masked Card Amount for cards made for $100 or more Using ACH as a Funding Source for Masked Cards $1 per card Masked Card service fee (every 30 days after card creation).\nNot applicable to residents of Connecticut and New Jersey.\n$5.95 Refund fee (refunding balance on a Masked Card to Funding Source such as a Personal Credit Card) Free Chargeback loss processing fee.\nOnly assessed if you file a Chargeback against Abine that we contest and win.\n$25 <br>\n<p>\n<strong>Refunding Masked Cards<\/strong>.\nMasked Cards have an expiration date.\nIf the Masked Card expires or if you deactivate it, any funds you've placed on it less any purchases or other fees will be automatically refunded to your Funding Method on or around the Masked Card's expiration date or the date of deactivation.\nIf your billing or contact information is incorrect or out of date, we may not be able to issue an automatic refund and will try to contact you to refund you.\nIf we're unsuccessful, applicable law may require us to report the balance on the Masked Card as unclaimed property, and we may be required to deliver any value remaining on it to the state as unclaimed property.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tell the truth (when we need you to)<\/strong>.\nMasked Card Services provide privacy and security through alias information, but Abine requires accurate

This Privacy Policy describes how we deal with your personal information if you visit abine.com or use Blur.\nThis Privacy Policy does not address DeleteMe, joindeleteme.com, or other Abine products, services, or websites.\nYou can learn more about how we use and protect DeleteMe, joindeleteme.com, or other Abine products, services, or websites in the joindeleteme.com Privacy Policy or by contacting us.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>We never sell your data.\nPeriod.<\/strong> If we share your data, it's only with companies we've hired to do work for us to carry out the services you want.\nThey'll never own it or be able to share it with anyone else.\nYour data is yours.\nWe do sometimes place online advertisements or pay affiliate partners for subscription sales they generate.\nThese systems may use IP address or order numbers to identity and record these sales.\nWe do not share information beyond what is needed for these transactions, but some of these companies may already be tracking you outside of our control (for instance by clicking on a google search result).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Philosophy.<\/strong> We're dedicated to consumer privacy rights and support privacy policies that are understandable.\nWe're committed to responsibly handling any information we collect.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data use.<\/strong> Many companies profit off their users by selling their information, but we'll never do that.\nWe only use the data we collect about the way people use our products and our website to build better products.\nWe'll never share any personal data about your online activity or use it to target you individually.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data sharing.<\/strong> A few things that you do may require us to share data.\nFor instance, when you buy one of our products with your credit card, we have to share that info to process the payment.\nWe try to do things ourselves but sometimes need to rely on external companies.\nWe make hard decisions about when to do so, always balancing the privacy risks against the benefits.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Law enforcement.<\/strong> We won't provide your information unless we're compelled by law through a valid court order, which is a much higher standard than the usual \"permitted by law\" standard.\nCompanies don't have to tell you when someone requests your data, but we will try and inform you, if we are legally allowed to do so, so you can be aware and take legal action if you choose.\n<\/p>\n<p> As of today, Abine has <strong>not<\/strong> received a national security order and we have not been required by a FISA court to keep any secrets.\n<\/p>\n<p> Except as required by law, Abine, Inc.\n<strong>will not share your data with third parties;<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p> Abine Inc.\nwill only retain user information for a maximum of <strong>6 months after a user has canceled a paid subscription<\/strong> (except for basic information that the transaction occurred), <b>and is no longer using our free service<\/b>, except for any payment-related information that we have to retain for fraud purposes.\n<\/p> Abine.com Website Privacy Policy <p> Abine Inc.'s goal is to help you regain control of your personal information online, and as such, we do not use tracking to collect any personal information on our abine.com website.\nOur privacy policy reflects this goal.\n<\/p>\n<p> We do not use persistent cookies generally on this site.\n<em>The only time we use a persistent (i.e., non-session) cookie is when we deliver your download to you<\/em>.\n<strong>We delete the cookie right after installation.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p> We log aggregate information about our site visitors, but it does not contain your name, Email, or other personally-identifiable information.\nThese logs are

set your browser to refuse cookies by following the instructions provided by your web browser.\n<\/p>\n<p> We won't share your data unless you are using specific services through us that require it or if we are ever compelled by legal orders, in which cases, we will share the minimum data required.\n<\/p>\n<p> We do not collect any personal information through the abine.com website.\nEven so, abine.com is not directed at individuals under 13 years of age in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).\n<\/p>\n<p> If you choose to sign up for our newsletters or to receive emailed updates of our privacy blog, we'll occasionally send you emails with coupons, announcements, and Abine news.\n<\/p>\n<p> We will sometimes link to other websites.\nYou should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party sites before using them.\nOur privacy policy does not apply to these other websites, and we cannot control their activities.\n<\/p> Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) &amp.\nBlur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile) Privacy Policy <p> Abine Inc.\nbuilt Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) &amp.\nBlur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile) around the principle of letting users protect their privacy, so <strong>Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile do not try and track your personal data<\/strong>.\nThey have a limited ability to collect data about what sites you visit and web behavior such as what forms you interact with (or we autofill), but we only use this anonymized data to improve our form detection and filling capabilities.\n<\/p>\n<p> By default, Blur (formerly DoNotTrackMe) &amp.\nBlur Mobile (formerly DoNotTrackMe Mobile) do not communicate with our servers except: 1) when getting new tracker-blocking rules or software versions, 2) obtaining updates to our form detection, 3) sending back form telemetry, such as form metadata, autofilled metrics, and any user-created crowdsourced form mappings.\nThe information sent to our servers is explicitly not tied to your account or other personal information.\n<strong>You can also opt-out of this kind of data collection in the application's settings<\/strong>.\n<\/p>\n<p> There are a few limited pieces of information we need to know to make sound decisions about the business from Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Information about your install of Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile<\/strong>, such as where you downloaded it, the original version you installed, the current version you have, and the month of your original install.\n<\/li>\n<li> Because there is a different version of Blur for each browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, IE), <strong>we know how many installs there have been for each browser<\/strong>.\n<\/li>\n<li> On a daily basis, <strong>we know how many users we have of Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile and whether those users are based in or outside the US<\/strong>.\n<\/li>\n<li> In order to improve our form detection capabilities, when you interact with forms <strong>we capture pieces of form meta-data and metrics<\/strong> such as if what we auto-filled into a form was then corrected by you.\nThis data collection is anonymized and explicitly not tied to your account information, and not received in real-time, only once a day.\n<\/li>\n<li> Lastly, <strong>we know how many visits to abine.com come from the Blur tool<\/strong>, but we do not know if any given add-on user clicked anything or other personal details.\n<\/li>\n<li> If you choose to interact with Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile to send us feedback, we may receive the following additional information that doesn't identify you: <strong>The description of the problem that you submit to us<\/strong> and <strong>the website URL and any trackers found on it<\/strong>.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p> All of your personal Masked Email, Masked Phone, and Masked Card data is encrypted using industry standard 256-bit AES encryption.\nThe information is accessed by the client in real time when the information is needed.\n<\/p>\n<p> If you're using Blur &amp.\nBlur Mobile Premium, we use specialty companies to process payments and phone calls and texts.\nThese service providers will have access to some of your data only to process it, but they'll never own it or share it with anyone else.\n<\/p> MaskMe &amp.\nMaskMe Mobile Privacy Policy <p> All of your accounts, passwords, and other browsing activity is stored locally in an encrypted database that we do not have the ability to decrypt.\nIt's encrypted using industry standard <strong>256-bit AES encryption<\/strong>.\nIf you choose to use the Sync feature to access your MaskMe data from any device, that means we're storing that data in an encrypted form on our servers - we

The type of information <strong>If you're using this feature of ...<\/strong>\n<strong>Your personal email address (optional)<\/strong> Abine has it because you have an account with us, and it lets us

only you can read the labels, but stored on Abine's servers.\nPlus any websites that you gave a Masked Email will have it.\n<strong>Senders of messages to your Masked Emails<\/strong> We know this

are temporarily cached in your Masked Inbox for less than 24 hours (by default), then permanently deleted from our servers.\n<strong>Your Blur &amp.\nMaskMe password (optional)<\/strong> Only you know

them through their interface.\n<strong>Who has charged your Masked Cards (merchants)<\/strong> We can see the merchant that charged your Masked Card (which doesn't always indicate the actual website).\nYour credit/debit card bill will show charges from \"ABINE\" (or) \"BLUR\" and not the actual merchant.\nOur bank partner can see who charged your Masked Card, but it is anonymous (in no

work<\/strong>.\n.\nMasked Card Solutions let you shop online more safely by letting you (\"user\" or \"you\") access and facilitate a payment using Masked Cards exclusively with the MCS software: a browser add-on and a web/mobile application.\nYou obtain access to the Masked Cards features by registering to use one of our “Masked Card Solutions” and, typically, fees are charged to the personal credit card you provide upon signup (your “Personal Credit Card”) or other Funding Sources you may have added.\nWhen you're shopping online at a retailer (“retailer,” “merchant”), you can choose to pay for products or services with a Masked Card during checkout by specifying the monetary amount of your purchase.\nThe Funding Source associated with your account will be charged the amount you specify.\nThe retailer will see only the Masked Credit Card number.<\/p>\n<p>You can view transaction details for all your Masked Cards from within MCS products such as Blur &amp.\nMaskMe by clicking on the Masked Cards icon, then clicking “view details” next to the Masked Card you wish to examine.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Key characteristics of Masked Cards<\/strong>.\nYou're buying the right to access Abine's credit line in the amount you specify for the Masked Cards you create.\nAs such, you'll see “Abine, Inc.” listed on your Personal Credit Card statement as the merchant, even though you'll spend the Masked Cards at other retailers.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Masked Cards need to be at least $10 in value, but no more than $500.<\/strong> They are assigned an expiration date when you create them.\nMasked Cards you create are issued by our bank partner as MasterCard numbers.\nMasked Cards are usable until their balance reaches zero, they expire, or you deactivate them.\nAbine reserves the right to change limits globally or for specific uses at any time and for any reason including suspicious activity.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Who gets your Personal Credit Card<\/strong>.\nWhen you use a Masked Card to purchase something from a merchant, that merchant will not see or have access to your Personal Credit Card.\nAbine uses a payments processor to process payments.\nWhen you sign up for one of our Masked Card Services or add money to a Masked Card, you're billed through our payment processor.\nOur payments processor stores or has access to your Personal Credit Card, but Abine, our bank partner, and MasterCard do not.<\/p>\n<p>For more details about the privacy of your personal information when you use Abine products, services, or websites, please visit our privacy policy at www.abine.com/legal.html.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Credit card authorizations<\/strong>.\nAs soon as the merchant where you use a Masked Card runs an authorization, that money is held on your Masked Card and can't be used (it will show up as \"pending\" to you when you view transaction details on a Masked Card).\nFor some authorizations, merchants might add an additional percentage hold on top of the purchase value (for example, 20% for a restaurant).<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>ACH Authorization<\/strong>.\nWhen you use your bank account as your Payment Method for any transaction or to fund Masked Cards, you are requesting an electronic transfer from your bank account.\nFor these transactions, Abine will make electronic transfers via ACH from your bank account in the amount specified by your or Abine (in the case of subscription payments).\nYou agree that such requests constitute your authorization to Abine.\nto make the transfers.\nOnce you have provided your authorization for the transfer, you will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Chargebacks and disputes with merchants<\/strong>.\nYou understand and agree that Abine is not responsible for the goods or services that you pay for using a Masked Card.\nEach seller that you purchase from is responsible for providing the goods and services that you purchase and for providing all customer service related to those goods and services.\nWe recommend that you review a seller's policies before completing your purchase.\nYou are responsible for resolving any disputes that you may have with a seller.\nIf you have exhausted all options for resolving a dispute with a seller, you may choose to file a dispute through Abine (see “How to file a Dispute” below).<\/p>\n<p>Disputing a charge from Abine on your bank statement that is related to a Masked Card purchase is filing a dispute against Abine, Inc.\nand will not only damage your relationship with Abine, but will not resolve any dispute with the seller of the item purchased with a Masked Card.\nAbine is the “issuing bank” for purchases completed with a Masked Card.\nIf you file a Chargeback against Abine that Abine contests and wins (i.e.\nyou lose the Chargeback) you will be charged a $25 chargeback processing fee.\nThere is no chargeback processing fee if you win a contested Chargeback.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Release of Abine,

Abine and our officers, directors, agents, employees, and suppliers from all claims, demands, and damages of any kind arising out of your dispute with a seller and Abine's review of your

resolve the issue and copies of supporting documentation (such as email correspondence, receipts, shipping confirmations, etc.) <\/li>\n<li>Provide any additional information or documentation that we may request.\nOnce Abine has decided the outcome of the Dispute, the parties will be notified of the decision.\nYou are required to comply with the decision and complete any actions required by such decision.\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>We can restrict or block the use of your Masked Cards for any reason<\/strong>.\nWe reserve the right to block or limit transactions at any time for

because of declined transactions.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Authorization to recover amounts due<\/strong>.\nIf a Masked Card is overdrawn (i.e.\nthe total amount of any transactions posted to a Masked Card is greater than the original Masked Card value), or the charge to fund a successfully used Masked Card fails to process, you authorize Abine and our Financial Institution Partners to take any of the following actions to recover the remaining amounts from you: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debit the credit/debit card or bank account linked to your paid subscription.<\/li>\n<li>Debit any of your other Masked

an ACH transaction that fails to process, you may be subject to the actions detailed above, plus an additional $25.00 bounced check fee.\nUsers can pay via another ACH transfer, or place a credit card on file to pay off the balance more quickly.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>You cannot sell or transfer a Masked Card to anyone else<\/strong>.\nA Masked Card can only be used by you or someone you authorize.\nIf

Any time you make a purchase with a Masked Card by inputting the monetary value of that purchase, you're authorizing Abine to charge your Funding Method in that amount.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>There may be a charge to create a Masked Card.<\/strong> If you are using a Credit Card as the Funding Source for your Masked Card then you may incur a service fee beyond that of the Masked Card amount.\nService Fees per the Schedule of Fees will be charged to the same Funding Source as was used to create the Masked Card or to any other Funding Source you might have.\nFees can be changed at any time.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Open Masked Cards will incur a Monthly Fee.<\/strong> After 30 days from the date the Masked Card was created, Masked Card you have that is open with a remaining balance will be charged a service fee (see below for current fees).\nThis will not be charged to your Funding Source, but will instead be withdrawn from remaining balance of the related Masked Card.\nIf there is an insufficient amount on the Masked Card to cover the monthly fee, it will be charged the remaining balance and the Masked Card will be closed.\nIf a Masked Card is used for a successful transaction within the 30 day period, it will not incur this monthly fee.<\/p>\n<strong>Schedule of Fees<\/strong> Fee Using a Personal Credit Card as a Funding Source $2 per card for cards under $100.\nAn additional 1.5% of the Masked Card Amount for cards made for $100 or more Using ACH as a Funding Source for Masked Cards $1 per card Masked Card service fee (every 30 days after card creation).\nNot applicable to residents of Connecticut and New Jersey.\n$5.95 Refund fee (refunding balance on a Masked Card to Funding Source such as a Personal Credit Card) Free Chargeback loss processing fee.\nOnly assessed if you file a Chargeback against Abine that we contest and win.\n$25 <br>\n<p>\n<strong>Refunding Masked Cards<\/strong>.\nMasked Cards have an expiration date.\nIf the Masked Card expires or if you deactivate it, any funds you've placed on it less any purchases or other fees will be automatically refunded to your Funding Method on or around the Masked Card's expiration date or the date of deactivation.\nIf your billing or contact information is incorrect or out of date, we may not be able to issue an automatic refund and will try to contact you to refund you.\nIf we're unsuccessful, applicable law may require us to report the balance on the Masked Card as unclaimed property, and we may be required to deliver any value remaining on it to the state as unclaimed property.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tell the truth (when we need you to)<\/strong>.\nMasked Card Services provide privacy and security through alias information, but Abine requires accurate information for all Masked Card Service users.\nTo help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money-laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who creates a Masked Card, including a verifiable U.S.\nstreet mailing address.\nYou authorize Abine, Inc., directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity.\nThis may include asking you for further information that will allow us to reasonably identify you, requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or financial instruments, ordering a credit report, or verifying your Information against third party databases or through other sources.\nWe may

yourself.\nIdentifying information will only be disclosed to third parties if Abine, Inc.\nis provided with the proper legal documentation (see “Privacy Policy” for more details).<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Authorization to update financial information<\/strong> If your credit card account number changes or your credit card expiration date changes, we may acquire that information from our financial services partner and update your Account.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Deactivating individual Masked Cards<\/strong>.\nYou can cancel a Masked Card you've created at any time just click on the Masked Cards icon at the top, open a list of the cards you've created, and click the “Refund” button next to the card you wish to deactivate.\nSee https://dnt.abine.com/#help/faq/faq-maskedcardrefund.\nAny funds remaining on the deactivated Masked Card will be refunded to the Funding Source used to purchase the Masked Card (typically within 3-7 days).<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Notices &amp.\nCommunications.\n<\/strong> By registering for any Masked Card Solution, using the service and accepting the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you
