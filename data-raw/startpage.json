what’s yours:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>It’s Your Data.\nNot Big Data! !<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Why we don’t collect any \"personal data\"<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>It’s the best way to safeguard your privacy.<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p>If information isn’t collected, it can’t be stolen, demanded, leaked or abused.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>How do we define \"personal data?\"<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>To maximize your privacy, we use a broad definition.<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p>Our definition of personal data is based on the privacy laws and regulations of the EU, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nThese are widely regarded as the strongest privacy protections in the world.\nWe consider any information about you or your behavior that can be traced back to you as personal data.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information we don’t collect<\/strong>\n<br>So let’s be perfectly clear:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>We don’t record your IP address<\/strong>\n<br>The only exception is for automated search requests (robots) that rapidly submit more queries to our servers than any normal human would.\nWhen our software detects potential abuse, we register and block the offending IP address in order to keep our service safe and free.<br>\n<br>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>We don’t serve any tracking or identifying cookies<\/strong>\n<br>This is about \"good\" and &nbsp;\"bad\" cookies .\nCookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your hard drive by websites you visit.\"Bad\" cookies have unique elements that can track all kinds of personal information.\nWe don’t serve any of those.\nStartpage uses just one \"good\" cookie called \"preferences\" in order to remember the search preferences you choose.\nIt’s completely anonymous and expires after not visiting Startpage for 90 days.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n<strong>We don’t record your search queries<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Saves us headaches and disk space.<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p> When you search, your query is automatically stripped of unnecessary metadata including your IP address and other identifying information.\nWe send the anonymized search query to Google and return the search results to you.\nWe don’t log your searches.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>To prevent abuse such as robotic high-volume querying, we anonymously determine the frequency of popular search keywords as a part of our anti-abuse measures, while protecting your privacy.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we have implemented truly anonymous analytics<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>We only count aggregate numbers.<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p>We do measure overall traffic numbers and some other – strictly anonymous – statistics.\nThese stats may include the number of times our service is accessed by a certain operating system, a type of browser, a language, etc., but we don’t know anything about individual users.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we keep Startpage.com free without using \"personal data\"<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Without tracking-ads - as we don’t share personal info with anyone.<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p>Most online advertising today is personalized, meaning that online advertising services track what you do online and profile you in order to serve tailored ads.\nWe don’t do that at Startpage.\nNo tracking.\nNo profiling!<\/p>\n<p> Our search result pages may include a small number of clearly labeled \"sponsored links,\" which generate revenue and cover our operational costs.\nThose links are retrieved from platforms such as Google AdSense.\nIn order to enable the prevention of click fraud, some non-identifying system information is shared, but because we never share personal information or information that could uniquely identify you, the ads we display are not connected to any individual user.<\/p>\n<p>It’s a myth that search engines need to profile you in order to earn decent money.\nStartpage serves strictly non-personalized ads.\nSure, our ads make only a fraction of what other search engine ads make, but they pay all our bills.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>We protect you on our site – and beyond<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>This privacy policy applies only to the Startpage.com website.<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p>Once you click on a search result, you leave our site and our privacy protection.\nThis is true for sponsored links, search results and other external links.\nUnless … you use our \"Anonymous View\" feature - shown next to the search results.\nThis is a great privacy tool that allows you to continue to browse in full privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Startpage's video search results are delivered in full privacy, provided by YouTube API Services.\nWhen clicking on video links, you will be redirected to YouTube, and subject to their YouTube Terms of Service
