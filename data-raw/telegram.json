What do I do here?\n<p>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free.\nYou can use Telegram on all your devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong> — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.<\/p>\n<p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and <strong>files<\/strong> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to <strong>200,000<\/strong> people or channels for broadcasting to <strong>unlimited<\/strong> audiences.\nYou can write to your phone contacts and find people by their <strong>usernames<\/strong>.\nAs a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs.\nIn addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted voice calls.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who is Telegram for?\n<p>Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and calls.\nBusiness users and small teams may like the large groups, usernames, desktop apps and powerful file sharing options.<\/p>\n<p>Since Telegram groups can have up to 200,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient.\nYou can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace.\nPublic groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.<\/p>\n<p>In case you're more into pictures, Telegram has animated gif search, a state of the art photo editor, and an open sticker platform (find some cool stickers here or here).\nWhat's more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device.\nWith Telegram's cloud support and cache management options, Telegram can take up nearly <strong>zero<\/strong> space on your phone.<\/p>\n<p>Those looking for extra privacy should check out our advanced settings and rather revolutionary policy.\nAnd if you want secrecy, try our device-specific Secret Chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional passcode.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We keep evolving — check out the blog and follow us on twitter and Telegram to stay in touch.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?\n<p>Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync.\nAs a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 2 GB <em>each<\/em>.\nAnd if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Telegram is faster and way more secure.\nOn top of that, Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.<\/p>\n<p>Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own Telegram apps.\nWe also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, integrate any services, and even accept payments from users around the world.\n<\/p>\n<p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\nDon't forget to check out this paragraph for even more exclusive stuff.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How old is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram for iOS was launched on August 14, 2013.\nThe alpha version of Telegram for Android officially launched on October 20, 2013.\nMore and more Telegram clients appear, built by independent developers using Telegram's open platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Which devices can I use?\n<p>You can use Telegram on smartphones, tablets, and even computers.\nWe have apps for iOS (9.0 and above), Android (4.1 and up) and Windows Phone.\nYou can also use Telegram's web version or install one of our desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can log in to Telegram from as many of your devices as you like — all <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use your main mobile phone number to log in everywhere.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Our API is open for developers, should you want to build your own applications for other platforms.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is supported by Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai.\nPavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai's input is technological.\nTo make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers.\nAs a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where is Telegram based?\n<p>The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St.\nPetersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of highly skilled engineers.\nThe Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore.\nWe’re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Will you have ads? Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?\n<p>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.<\/p>\n<p>Pavel Durov, who shares our vision, supplied Telegram with a generous donation, so we have quite enough money for the time being.\nIf Telegram runs out, we will introduce non-essential paid options to support the infrastructure and finance developer salaries.\nBut making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?\n<p>Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years.\nTheir marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts from the people around you.\nAdding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities.\nTelegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, without the usual caveats.\nThis means that instead of diverting public attention with low-impact settings, we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What about GDPR?\n<p>New regulations regarding data privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018.\nSince taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn't much we had to change.\nWe don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we're not part of any mafia family “family of companies.”<\/p>\n<p>Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service — for example, your cloud chats so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more information.<\/p>\n<p>You can use <strong>@GDPRbot<\/strong> to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request a copy of all your data that Telegram stores.<\/li>\n<li>Contact us about Data Privacy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Android users got a GDPR update with version 4.8.9 which allows more control over synced contacts and adds other privacy settings.\nOn June, 1, Apple approved Telegram v.4.8.2 for iOS with these features.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: There's illegal content on Telegram.\nHow do I take it down?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.<\/p>\n<p>But <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.\nIf you find sticker sets or bots on Telegram that you think are illegal, please ping us at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the 'report' buttons right inside our apps, see this post on our official @ISISwatch channel for details.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: If a scammer is pretending to be you, contact @NoToScam<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright.\nWhat do I do?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.\nBut <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org.\nPlease note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?\n<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet.\nTo do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal <strong>public<\/strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app.\nFor example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.<\/p>\n<p>User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI.\nWhenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that this does <strong>not<\/strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.\nFor example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship.\nThis goes against our founders' principles.\nWhile we do block terrorist (e.g.\nISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do I do?\n<p>If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you process data requests?\n<p>Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose.<\/p>\n<p>To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure.\nCloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions.\nThe relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect.\nAs a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression.\nTelegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.<\/p>\n<p>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Basics\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can I write to?\n<p>You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram.\nAnother way of contacting people is to type their Telegram username into the search field.<\/p>\n<p>You can set a public username for your Telegram account too.\nOther people will be able to search and find you by that username — and send messages to you even if they don't know your number.\nYou can learn more about usernames here.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I know who in my contacts has Telegram?\n<p>Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts.\nThey also have pictures.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I invite my friends?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> The basic invitations are simple SMS messages.\nThey will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage).\nNaturally, you have other options to bring your friends here.\nTry sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it.\nThe link: <strong>\n<\/strong>\n<strong>https://telegram.org/dl/<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Windows Phone:<\/em> Go to Contacts &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can give your friends a t.me link with your username so that they can easily find you on Telegram even if they don't have your phone number.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do the check marks mean?\n<p>\n<em>One check<\/em> — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.<br>\n<em>Two checks<\/em> — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).<\/p>\n<p>We don't have a 'delivered to device' status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want.\nSo which particular one would that check mean?<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I hide my ‘last seen’ time?\n<p>You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own.\nYou will, however, see an approximate last seen value.\nThis keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram.\nThere are four possible approximate values:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen recently<\/strong> — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a week<\/strong> — between 2-3 and seven days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a month<\/strong> — between 6-7 days and a month<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen a long time ago<\/strong> — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see me 'online'?\n<p>The last seen rules apply to your online status as well.\nPeople can only see you online if you're sharing your last seen status with them.<\/p>\n<p>There are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online.\nRegardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<li>Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.<\/li>\n<li>Broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you're not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don't do anything of the above, they'll never see you online.\nAnother way of achieving this is to block that person.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I delete my messages?\n<p>Yes.\nPreviously, you could unsend your messages within 48 hours after sending them.\nAs of Telegram 5.5, you can always delete any messages you sent or received in <em>any<\/em> one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own messages only).\nYou can also clear the entire chat history on both ends.\nOn Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.<\/p>\n<p>Together with privacy settings for forwarded messages, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder).\nAs a result, our users no longer need to worry about the data accumulating in their chats over the years.\nBoth parties in a conversation now have full control over what does and what doesn't belong to their online identity.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I make calls via Telegram?\n<p>Yes! Voice calls are currently available to users around the world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How can I use emoticons in Telegram on my iOS device?\n<p>We support emoji emoticons.\nSimply enable the Emoji keyboard in your iOS device's Settings (General &gt.\nKeyboards &gt.\nAdd New Keyboard… &gt.\nEmoji).\nThen switch to that keyboard whenever you're out of words.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Groups and Channels\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What makes Telegram groups cool?\n<p>Telegram groups can have up to <strong>200,000 members<\/strong> each and are extremely powerful communication tools.\nHere are a few key features that make them stand out in the messaging world: <\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unified history<\/strong>\n<br>Edit your messages after posting, delete them so that they disappear for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cross-platform availability<\/strong>\n<br>Access your messages anytime, from any number of your mobile or desktop devices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Instant search<\/strong>\n<br>Find the message you're looking for, even among millions.\nFilter by sender to make searching easier.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Replies, mentions, hashtags<\/strong>\n<br>Easily trace a conversation and keep communication efficient, no matter the group size.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Smart notifications<\/strong>\n<br>Mute the group to get notifications only when people mention you or reply to your messages.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pinned messages<\/strong>\n<br>You can pin any message to be displayed at the top of the chat screen.\nAll members will get a notification — even if they muted ordinary messages from your group.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Moderation tools<\/strong>\n<br>Appoint administrators that can mass-delete messages, control membership, and pin important messages.\nDefine their admin privileges with granular precision.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Group permissions<\/strong>\n<br>Set default permissions to restrict all members from posting specific kinds of content.\nOr even restrict members from sending messages altogether – and let the admins chat amongst themselves while everybody else is watching.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>File sharing<\/strong>\n<br>Send and receive files of any type, up to 2 GB in size each, access them instantly on your other devices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Public groups<\/strong>\n<br>Get a short link for your group and make it public, like t.me/publictestgroup.\nThis way, anybody can view the group's entire chat history and join to post messages.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customization via bots<\/strong>\n<br>Create custom tools for any specific needs using our Bot API and Inline Bots.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What's the difference between groups and channels?\n<p>Telegram <strong>groups<\/strong> are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams.\nBut groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members.\nYou can make any group <strong>public<\/strong>, toggle <strong>persistent history<\/strong> to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint <strong>administrators<\/strong> with granular privileges.\nYou can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Channels<\/strong> are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences.\nIn fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers.\nWhen you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your own.\nEach message in a channel has a <strong>view counter<\/strong> that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about channels in the Channels FAQ »<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a group?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Start a new message (tap the icon in the top right corner in Chats) &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Tap the circular pencil icon in the chat list &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:<\/em> Click the menu button in the top left corner &gt.\n'New Group'.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I assign administrators?\n<p>You can add administrators to help you manage your group and define their privileges with granular precision.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Go to Group Info (tap the photo in the top right corner on the group‘s chat screen) &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Go to Group Info (tap the name in the header) &gt.\nthe pencil icon (in the top right corner) &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:<\/em> When in the group, click '…' in the top right corner &gt.\nManage group &gt.\nAdministrators.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I add more members? What's an invite link?\n<p>You can add your contacts, or using search by username.<\/p>\n<p>It is easy to migrate existing groups to Telegram by sending people an <strong>invite link<\/strong>.\nTo create an invite link, go to Group Info &gt.\nAdd Member &gt.\nInvite to Group via Link.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who has Telegram installed will be able to join your group by following this link.\nIf you choose to revoke the link, it will stop working immediately.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about invite links in our blog »<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Usernames and t.me\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are usernames? How do I get one?\n<p>You can set up a <strong>public<\/strong> username on Telegram.\nIt then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username — you will appear in contacts search under 'global results'.\nPlease note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username in Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does t.me work?\n<p>Once you've set up a username, you can give people a t.me/username link.\nOpening that link on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you.\nYou can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.<\/p>\n<p>This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What can I use as my username?\n<p>You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores.\nUsernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g.\nTelegram and TeleGram is the same user).\nThe username must be at least five characters long.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need a username?\n<p>You don't have to get one.\nRemember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number?\n<p>No.\nNeither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your privacy settings).\nThis is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my username?\n<p>Go to Settings and save an empty username.\nThis will remove your username.\npeople will no longer be able to find you via search.\nThis will not affect existing conversations.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do I do if my username is taken?\n<p>Telegram usernames are distributed on a first come — first serve basis.<\/p>\n<p>We understand that certain usernames are

useful as well.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How secure is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line.\nWe are based on the MTProto protocol (see description and advanced FAQ), built upon time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections.\nWe are continuously working with the community to improve the security of our protocol and clients.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if I’m more paranoid than your regular user?\n<p>We've got you covered.\nTelegram’s special secret chats use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding.\nOn top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: So how do you encrypt data?\n<p>We support two layers of secure encryption.\nServer-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption.\nAll data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files.<\/p>\n<p>Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.\nYou can find more info in the Advanced FAQ.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Do you process data requests?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why should I trust you?\n<p>Telegram is open, anyone can check our source code, protocol and API, see how everything works and make an informed decision.\nTelegram supports verifiable builds, which allow experts to independently verify that our code published on GitHub is the <strong>exact same code<\/strong> that is used to build the apps you download from App Store or Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome security experts to audit our system and appreciate any feedback at security@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, Telegram's primary focus is not to bring a profit, so commercial interests will never interfere with our mission.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need to trust Telegram for this to be secure?\n<p>When it comes to secret chats, you don't — just make sure that the visualized key of your secret chat matches the one in your friend's secret chat settings.\nMore about this below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if my hacker friend says they could decipher Telegram messages?\n<p>Anyone who claims that Telegram messages can be deciphered is welcome to prove that claim in our competition and win $300,000.\nYou can check out the Cracking Contest Description to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>Any comments on Telegram's security are welcome at security@telegram.org.\nAll submissions which result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging from <strong>$100<\/strong> to <strong>$100,000<\/strong> or more, depending on the severity of the issue.\nPlease note that we can not offer bounties for issues that are disclosed to the public before they are fixed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can Telegram protect me against everything?\n<p>Telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication.\nThis means that all data (including media and files) that you send and receive via Telegram cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your internet service provider, owners of Wi-Fi routers you connect to, or other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>But please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she takes your unlocked phone without a passcode.\nOr from your IT-department if they access your computer at work.\nOr from any other people that get physical or root access to your phones or computers running Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>If you have reasons to worry about your personal security, we strongly recommend using only Secret Chats in official or at least verifiable open-source apps for sensitive information, preferably with a self-destruct timer.\nWe also recommend enabling 2-Step Verification and setting up a strong passcode to lock your app, you will find both options in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does 2-Step Verification work?\n<p>Logging in with an SMS code is an industry standard in messaging, but if you're looking for more security or have reasons to doubt your mobile carrier or government, we recommend protecting your cloud chats with an additional password.<\/p>\n<p>You can do this in <strong>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\n2-Step Verification<\/strong>.\nOnce enabled, you will need both an SMS code and a password to log in.\nYou can also set up a recovery email address that will help regain access, should you forget your password.\nIf you do so, please remember that it's important that the recovery email account is also protected with a strong password and 2-Step Verification when possible.<\/p>\n<p>Check this out for tips on creating a strong password that is easy to remember.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous?\n<p>Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — root access.<\/p>\n<p>A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the internal storage.\nOnce an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile.\nNo application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Secret Chats\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are secret chats different?\n<p>Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella.\nAll messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (more on this here).\nOn top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats.\nAnd when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well.<\/p>\n<p>You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient.\nThe message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices.<\/p>\n<p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud.\nThis means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin.\nThey are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I start a secret chat?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Open the profile of the user you want to contact.\nTap on ‘…’, then ‘Start Secret Chat’.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Swipe right to open the menu, then 'New secret chat'.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific.\nIf you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device.\nIf you log out, you will lose all your secret chats.\nYou can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do self-destructing messages work?\n<p>The Self-Destruct Timer is available for <strong>all messages<\/strong> in Secret Chats and for <strong>media<\/strong> in private cloud chats.<\/p>\n<p>To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit.\nThe clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets two check marks).\nAs soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from <strong>both<\/strong> devices.\nWe will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent <strong>after<\/strong> the timer was set.\nIt has no effect on earlier messages.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I be certain that my conversation partner doesn't take a screenshot?\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices).\nWe will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently.\nWe advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust.\nAfter all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with a different device or an old school camera.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What is this 'Encryption Key' thing?\n<p>When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\nAfter the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat.\nYou can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app.<\/p>\n<p>Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not just make all chats 'secret'?\n<p>All Telegram messages are always securely encrypted.\nMessages in Secret Chats use <strong>client-client<\/strong> encryption, while Cloud Chats use <strong>client-server/server-client<\/strong> encryption and are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more here).\nThis enables your cloud messages to be both secure and immediately accessible from any of your devices – even if you lose your device altogether.<\/p>\n<p>The problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected device (e.g.\nwhen you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in the end-to-end encryption paradigm.\nAt the same time, reliable backups are an essential feature for any mass-market messenger.\nTo solve this problem, some applications (like Whatsapp and Viber) allow decryptable backups that put their users' privacy at risk – even if they do not enable backups themselves.\nOther apps ignore the need for backups altogether and fade into oblivion before ever reaching a million users.<\/p>\n<p>We opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats.\nTelegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of Cloud Chats.\nMeanwhile, the separate entity of Secret Chats gives you full control over the data you do not want to be stored.<\/p>\n<p>This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries.\nWe are convinced that the separation of conversations into Cloud and Secret chats represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular messaging application.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Why Telegram isn't End-to-End Encrypted “by Default”<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Your Account\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see my phone number?\n<p>On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number visible.\nBy default, your number is only visible to people who you've added to your address book as contacts.\nYou can further modify this in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\nPhone Number<\/em>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that people will always see your number if they know it already and <strong>saved<\/strong> it in their address book.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: I have a new phone number, what do I do?\n<p>Each phone number is a <strong>separate<\/strong> account on Telegram.\nYou have several options if you are using multiple phone numbers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you will <strong>no longer use the old number<\/strong> (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to Settings and change the number connected to your Telegram account to the new number.\n<strong>Important:<\/strong> make sure you have access to your connected phone number – otherwise you risk losing access to your account.<\/li>\n<li>If you will use the new number for a <strong>limited time<\/strong> (e.g., you're on a trip or vacation), there's no need to do anything.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to keep using <strong>both numbers<\/strong> (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number.\nYou <em>may<\/em> create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated.\nIt is possible to log in to one Telegram app with up to <strong>3<\/strong> different accounts at once.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I log out?\n<p>Most users don't need to log out of Telegram:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Telegram on many devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use the same phone number to log in on all devices.<\/li>\n<li>You can go to <em>Settings &gt.\nData and Storage &gt.\nStorage Usage&gt.\nClear cache<\/em> to <strong>free up space<\/strong> on your device without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram with <strong>multiple phone numbers<\/strong>, you can switch between accounts without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram on a <strong>shared device<\/strong>, you can set up a passcode in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security<\/em> to make sure only you have access to your account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you do want to log out for some reason, here's how you do that:<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nLog out.<br>\n<em>Android<\/em>, <em>Telegram Desktop<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\n… (in the top right corner) &gt.\nLog out.<\/p>\n<p>If you log out, you will keep all your cloud messages.\nHowever, you <strong>will lose<\/strong> all your <strong>Secret Chats<\/strong> and <strong>all messages<\/strong> inside those secret chats when you log out.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that logging out does <strong>not<\/strong> trigger remote deletion of your secret chat messages on your partner's device — to do that, choose 'Clear History' first.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I change my phone number?\n<p>You can change your number in Telegram and keep <strong>everything<\/strong>, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices.<\/p>\n<p>To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then 'Change Number'.\nIf you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account first.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my account?\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account permanently removes all your <strong>messages<\/strong> and <strong>contacts<\/strong>.\nAll groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights.<\/p>\n<p>This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process.<br>Note that you'll receive the <strong>code<\/strong> via <strong>Telegram<\/strong>, not SMS.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What happens if I delete my account?\n<p>As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted.\nThat said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have <em>their<\/em> copy of the messages you sent them.\nSo if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our self-destruct timer instead.<\/p>\n<p>Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible.\nIf you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back.\nPeople, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified.\nThe new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does account self-destruction work?\n<p>Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space greatly.\nIf you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least six months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My phone was stolen, what do I do?\n<p>First of all, sorry about your phone.\nUnfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment.\nWe don't collect additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account.\nThis means we can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number or to Telegram itself on any of your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>I have access to Telegram on another device\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security and turn on Two-Step Verification.\nThis way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account.<\/li>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.\nWhoever has your phone will not be able to log in again, since they don't know your password.<\/li>\n<li>Contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>If you decide to switch to a new phone number, don't forget to go to Settings, tap on your phone number and change your Telegram number to the new one.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>I don't have access to Telegram on any other devices\n<ol>\n<li>First and foremost, you need to contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>Wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Removing sensitive data\n<p>Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn't much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft.\nBut if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to log out the other device, it is best that you wipe it remotely.\nYou can read more about it here: Apple iOS, Android.\nUnfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario.<\/p>\n<p>You can delete your Telegram account if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop).\nNote that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 6 months being the default setting.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Bots\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer, you may find our Bots FAQ more useful.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are bots?\n<p>Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram.\nThey are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a bot?\n<p>Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming.\nIf you're sure you're up to it, our <strong>Introduction for Developers<\/strong> is a good place to start.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer.\nBut we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop?\n<p>If you don't want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as you would block a human user.\nSome Telegram clients have a 'Stop Bot' button right in the bot's profile.<\/p>\n<p>That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its <em>/help<\/em> for clues.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots safe?\n<p>Yes.\nBots are no different from human users that you meet in groups for example.\nThey can see your public name, username, and profile pictures, and they can see messages you send to them, that's it.\nThey can't access your last seen status and <strong>don't<\/strong> see your phone number (unless you decide to give it to them yourself).<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger — don't give them your passwords, Telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely.\nAlso, be careful when opening files sent by bots, same as you would deal with ordinary humans.\nExample: If a bot sent us a file called <em>OpenMe.exe<\/em>, we probably wouldn't open it.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If I add a bot to my group, can it read my messages?\n<p>Bots can work in two modes when you add them to groups.\nBy default, bots only see messages that are meant for them.\nIn this case, you'll see 'has no access to messages' in the group members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Some bots need more information to work, so developers may disable the privacy mode.\nIn this case, the bot will see all messages sent to the group, and you will see 'has access to messages' in the members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about privacy mode for bots »<\/p>\n<p>If your group contains very sensitive information, maybe it's better to avoid adding bots you don't trust 100%.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots made by Telegram?\n<p>No.\nWhile we have some official bots for specific purposes (like @gif or @GDPRbot), we don't usually make bots.\nBots are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API and platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where can I find more bots?\n<p>There is no official store at the moment, so you'll have to ask your friends or search the web for now.\nWe're pretty sure you'll find some bots to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Deeper questions\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not open source everything?\n<p>All code will be released eventually.\nWe started with the most useful parts — a well-documented API that allows developers to build new Telegram apps, and open source clients that can be verified by security specialists.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I run Telegram using my own server?\n<p>Our architecture does not support federation yet.\nTelegram is a unified cloud service, so creating forks where two users might end up on two different Telegram clouds is unacceptable.\nTo enable you to run your own Telegram server while retaining both speed and security is a task in itself.\nAt the moment, we are undecided on whether or not Telegram should go in this direction.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I use the Telegram API?\n<p>Yes.\nDevelopers for all platforms are welcome to use our protocol, API and even source code.\nCheck out the Getting started section of the docs.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't forget about our Bot API that lets you build cool stuff on our

names.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you are using the latest version of the app.<\/li>\n<li>Relaunch the app (by terminating it from processes list and launching again).<\/li>\n<li>Temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again).<\/li>\n<li>If that didn't help, re-login.\nRemember that logging out kills your Secret Chats.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Force quit the app (double tap home button, then swipe up on Telegram), then relaunch and check if it helped.<\/li>\n<li>If that doesn't help, temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again).<\/li>\n<li>If that doesn’t work, re-login: Settings &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nLog Out.\nRemember that logging out kills all your Secret Chats.\nThen log in again.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Deleting contacts on Android\n<p>To delete a contact, open a chat with the person, tap on their profile photo in the top area of the chat screen, then tap on '…' in the top right corner &gt.\n'Delete'.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete the contact completely, make sure you also delete them from your phone contacts.\nTelegram stays in sync and will add the contact back if you don't.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Where did my Secret Chat messages go?\n<p>Secret Chats are established between the two devices they were created on.\nThis means that all those messages are not available in the cloud and cannot be accessed on other devices.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Secret Chats are also tied to your current login session on the device.\nIf you log out and in again, you will lose all your Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Can't send messages to non-contacts\n<p>When users report unwanted messages from a Telegram account, we apply a limit: Reported accounts can only send messages to people who have their number saved as a contact.<\/p>\n<p>This means that if you randomly contact people you don't know and send them annoying messages, you may lose the ability to do so in the future.<\/p>\n<p>If you think that this limit was applied to your account wrongly, please visit this page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram uses the camera or microphone in the background!\n<p>Telegram can use the <strong>microphone<\/strong> in the background if you minimize the app when making a call, recording a video, or recording a voice/video message.<\/p>\n<p>Permission monitors on Samsung and Xiaomi can inadvertently flag and notify you that Telegram requested access to <strong>camera<\/strong> in the background.\nThis happens when the app requests info about the camera — it isn’t using the camera.\nUnfortunately it may look the same to the Samsung and Xiaomi permission monitors.<\/p>\n<p>Camera info is requested by the app when you tap on the attachment button, or start recording a video or a video message.\nIf you do this and quickly close the app, the already initiated request may try to run asynchronously when the app is already in the background, or be sent when the system wakes up the app to show a notification about a new message.\nIn any case, these requests are only for the camera info, the app <em>never<\/em> uses the camera itself in the background.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can check Telegram’s open source code and confirm that the app is not doing anything behind their back.\nWe also offer reproducible builds that can help you prove that the version you downloaded from App Store or Google Play is built from the exact same source code we publish.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Support\n<p>If you have any other questions, please contact Telegram Support (in Telegram go to Settings — Ask a question).\nNote that we rely on volunteers for support.<\/p>\n<p>If you can't log in to your account, please use this form.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Twitter?\n<p>Yep.\nFollow us! <strong>@telegram<\/strong>\n<br>Our twitter account in Spanish:

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or

authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective

What do I do here?\n<p>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free.\nYou can use Telegram on all your devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong> — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.<\/p>\n<p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and <strong>files<\/strong> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to <strong>200,000<\/strong> people or channels for broadcasting to <strong>unlimited<\/strong> audiences.\nYou can write to your phone contacts and find people by their <strong>usernames<\/strong>.\nAs a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs.\nIn addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted voice calls.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who is Telegram for?\n<p>Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and calls.\nBusiness users and small teams may like the large groups, usernames, desktop apps and powerful file sharing options.<\/p>\n<p>Since Telegram groups can have up to 200,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient.\nYou can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace.\nPublic groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.<\/p>\n<p>In case you're more into pictures, Telegram has animated gif search, a state of the art photo editor, and an open sticker platform (find some cool stickers here or here).\nWhat's more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device.\nWith Telegram's cloud support and cache management options, Telegram can take up nearly <strong>zero<\/strong> space on your phone.<\/p>\n<p>Those looking for extra privacy should check out our advanced settings and rather revolutionary policy.\nAnd if you want secrecy, try our device-specific Secret Chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional passcode.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We keep evolving — check out the blog and follow us on twitter and Telegram to stay in touch.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?\n<p>Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync.\nAs a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 2 GB <em>each<\/em>.\nAnd if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Telegram is faster and way more secure.\nOn top of that, Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.<\/p>\n<p>Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own Telegram apps.\nWe also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, integrate any services, and even accept payments from users around the world.\n<\/p>\n<p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\nDon't forget to check out this paragraph for even more exclusive stuff.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How old is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram for iOS was launched on August 14, 2013.\nThe alpha version of Telegram for Android officially launched on October 20, 2013.\nMore and more Telegram clients appear, built by independent developers using Telegram's open platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Which devices can I use?\n<p>You can use Telegram on smartphones, tablets, and even computers.\nWe have apps for iOS (9.0 and above), Android (4.1 and up) and Windows Phone.\nYou can also use Telegram's web version or install one of our desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can log in to Telegram from as many of your devices as you like — all <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use your main mobile phone number to log in everywhere.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Our API is open for developers, should you want to build your own applications for other platforms.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is supported by Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai.\nPavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai's input is technological.\nTo make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers.\nAs a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where is Telegram based?\n<p>The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St.\nPetersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of highly skilled engineers.\nThe Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore.\nWe’re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Will you have ads? Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?\n<p>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.<\/p>\n<p>Pavel Durov, who shares our vision, supplied Telegram with a generous donation, so we have quite enough money for the time being.\nIf Telegram runs out, we will introduce non-essential paid options to support the infrastructure and finance developer salaries.\nBut making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?\n<p>Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years.\nTheir marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts from the people around you.\nAdding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities.\nTelegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, without the usual caveats.\nThis means that instead of diverting public attention with low-impact settings, we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What about GDPR?\n<p>New regulations regarding data privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018.\nSince taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn't much we had to change.\nWe don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we're not part of any mafia family “family of companies.”<\/p>\n<p>Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service — for example, your cloud chats so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more information.<\/p>\n<p>You can use <strong>@GDPRbot<\/strong> to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request a copy of all your data that Telegram stores.<\/li>\n<li>Contact us about Data Privacy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Android users got a GDPR update with version 4.8.9 which allows more control over synced contacts and adds other privacy settings.\nOn June, 1, Apple approved Telegram v.4.8.2 for iOS with these features.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: There's illegal content on Telegram.\nHow do I take it down?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.<\/p>\n<p>But <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.\nIf you find sticker sets or bots on Telegram that you think are illegal, please ping us at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the 'report' buttons right inside our apps, see this post on our official @ISISwatch channel for details.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: If a scammer is pretending to be you, contact @NoToScam<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright.\nWhat do I do?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.\nBut <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org.\nPlease note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?\n<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet.\nTo do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal <strong>public<\/strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app.\nFor example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.<\/p>\n<p>User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI.\nWhenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that this does <strong>not<\/strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.\nFor example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship.\nThis goes against our founders' principles.\nWhile we do block terrorist (e.g.\nISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do I do?\n<p>If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you process data requests?\n<p>Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose.<\/p>\n<p>To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure.\nCloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions.\nThe relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect.\nAs a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression.\nTelegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.<\/p>\n<p>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Basics\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can I write to?\n<p>You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram.\nAnother way of contacting people is to type their Telegram username into the search field.<\/p>\n<p>You can set a public username for your Telegram account too.\nOther people will be able to search and find you by that username — and send messages to you even if they don't know your number.\nYou can learn more about usernames here.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I know who in my contacts has Telegram?\n<p>Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts.\nThey also have pictures.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I invite my friends?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> The basic invitations are simple SMS messages.\nThey will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage).\nNaturally, you have other options to bring your friends here.\nTry sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it.\nThe link: <strong>\n<\/strong>\n<strong>https://telegram.org/dl/<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Windows Phone:<\/em> Go to Contacts &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can give your friends a t.me link with your username so that they can easily find you on Telegram even if they don't have your phone number.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do the check marks mean?\n<p>\n<em>One check<\/em> — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.<br>\n<em>Two checks<\/em> — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).<\/p>\n<p>We don't have a 'delivered to device' status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want.\nSo which particular one would that check mean?<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I hide my ‘last seen’ time?\n<p>You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own.\nYou will, however, see an approximate last seen value.\nThis keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram.\nThere are four possible approximate values:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen recently<\/strong> — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a week<\/strong> — between 2-3 and seven days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a month<\/strong> — between 6-7 days and a month<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen a long time ago<\/strong> — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see me 'online'?\n<p>The last seen rules apply to your online status as well.\nPeople can only see you online if you're sharing your last seen status with them.<\/p>\n<p>There are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online.\nRegardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<li>Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.<\/li>\n<li>Broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you're not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don't do anything of the above, they'll never see you online.\nAnother way of achieving this is to block that person.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I delete my messages?\n<p>Yes.\nPreviously, you could unsend your messages within 48 hours after sending them.\nAs of Telegram 5.5, you can always delete any messages you sent or received in <em>any<\/em> one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own messages only).\nYou can also clear the entire chat history on both ends.\nOn Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.<\/p>\n<p>Together with privacy settings for forwarded messages, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to

How do I get one?\n<p>You can set up a <strong>public<\/strong> username on Telegram.\nIt then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username — you will appear in contacts search under 'global results'.\nPlease note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username in Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does t.me work?\n<p>Once you've set up a username, you can give people a t.me/username link.\nOpening that link on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you.\nYou can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.<\/p>\n<p>This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What can I use as my username?\n<p>You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores.\nUsernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g.\nTelegram and TeleGram is the same user).\nThe username must be at least five characters long.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need a username?\n<p>You don't have to get one.\nRemember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number?\n<p>No.\nNeither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your privacy settings).\nThis is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my username?\n<p>Go to Settings and save an empty username.\nThis will remove your username.\npeople will no longer be able to find you via search.\nThis will not affect existing conversations.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do I do if my username is taken?\n<p>Telegram usernames are distributed on a first come — first serve basis.<\/p>\n<p>We understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some of us.\nIf your desired username is already taken, we will be happy to help you acquire it for your account or channel, provided that you have that same username on at least <strong>two<\/strong> of these services: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the fact that one account can register multiple bot and channel usernames, we reserve the right to recall usernames assigned to unused bots and channels, as well as openly squatted usernames.<\/p>\n<p>To request a username, contact @Username_bot.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if someone is pretending to

useful as well.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How secure is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line.\nWe are based on the MTProto protocol (see description and advanced FAQ), built upon time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections.\nWe are continuously working with the community to improve the security of our protocol and clients.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if I’m more paranoid than your regular user?\n<p>We've got you covered.\nTelegram’s special secret chats use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding.\nOn top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: So how do you encrypt data?\n<p>We support two layers of secure encryption.\nServer-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption.\nAll data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files.<\/p>\n<p>Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.\nYou can find more info in the Advanced FAQ.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Do you process data requests?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why should I trust you?\n<p>Telegram is open, anyone can check our source code, protocol and API, see how everything works and make an informed decision.\nTelegram supports verifiable builds, which allow experts to independently verify that our code published on GitHub is the <strong>exact same code<\/strong> that is used to build the apps you download from App Store or Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome security experts to audit our system and appreciate any feedback at security@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, Telegram's primary focus is not to bring a profit, so commercial interests will never interfere with our mission.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need to trust Telegram for this to be secure?\n<p>When it comes to secret chats, you don't — just make sure that the visualized key of your secret chat matches the one in your friend's secret chat settings.\nMore about this below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if my hacker friend says they could decipher Telegram messages?\n<p>Anyone who claims that Telegram messages can be deciphered is welcome to prove that claim in our competition and win $300,000.\nYou can check out the Cracking Contest Description to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>Any comments on Telegram's security are welcome at security@telegram.org.\nAll submissions which result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging from <strong>$100<\/strong> to <strong>$100,000<\/strong> or more, depending on the severity of the issue.\nPlease note that we can not offer bounties for issues that are disclosed to the public before they are fixed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can Telegram protect me against everything?\n<p>Telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication.\nThis means that all data (including media and files) that you send and receive via Telegram cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your internet service provider, owners of Wi-Fi routers you connect to, or other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>But please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she takes your unlocked phone without a passcode.\nOr from your IT-department if they access your computer at work.\nOr from any other people that get physical or root access to your phones or computers running Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>If you have reasons to worry about your personal security, we strongly recommend using only Secret Chats in official or at least verifiable open-source apps for sensitive information, preferably with a self-destruct timer.\nWe also recommend enabling 2-Step Verification and setting up a strong passcode to lock your app, you will find both options in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does 2-Step Verification work?\n<p>Logging in with an SMS code is an industry standard in messaging, but if you're looking for more security or have reasons to doubt your mobile carrier or government, we recommend protecting your cloud chats with an additional password.<\/p>\n<p>You can do this in <strong>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\n2-Step Verification<\/strong>.\nOnce enabled, you will need both an SMS code and a password to log in.\nYou can also set up a recovery email address that will help regain access, should you forget your password.\nIf you do so, please remember that it's important that the recovery email account is also protected with a strong password and 2-Step Verification when possible.<\/p>\n<p>Check this out for tips on creating a strong password that is easy to remember.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous?\n<p>Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — root access.<\/p>\n<p>A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the internal storage.\nOnce an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile.\nNo application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Secret Chats\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are secret chats different?\n<p>Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella.\nAll messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (more on this here).\nOn top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats.\nAnd when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well.<\/p>\n<p>You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient.\nThe message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices.<\/p>\n<p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud.\nThis means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin.\nThey are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I start a secret chat?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Open the profile of the user you want to contact.\nTap on ‘…’, then ‘Start Secret Chat’.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Swipe right to open the menu, then 'New secret chat'.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific.\nIf you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device.\nIf you log out, you will lose all your secret chats.\nYou can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do self-destructing messages work?\n<p>The Self-Destruct Timer is available for <strong>all messages<\/strong> in Secret Chats and for <strong>media<\/strong> in private cloud chats.<\/p>\n<p>To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit.\nThe clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets two check marks).\nAs soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from <strong>both<\/strong> devices.\nWe will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent <strong>after<\/strong> the timer was set.\nIt has no effect on earlier messages.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I be certain that my conversation partner doesn't take a screenshot?\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices).\nWe will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently.\nWe advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust.\nAfter all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with a different device or an old school camera.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What is this 'Encryption Key' thing?\n<p>When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\nAfter the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat.\nYou can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app.<\/p>\n<p>Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not just make all chats 'secret'?\n<p>All Telegram messages are always securely encrypted.\nMessages in Secret Chats use <strong>client-client<\/strong> encryption, while Cloud Chats use <strong>client-server/server-client<\/strong> encryption and are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more here).\nThis enables your cloud messages to be both secure and immediately accessible from any of your devices – even if you lose your device altogether.<\/p>\n<p>The problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected device (e.g.\nwhen you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in the end-to-end encryption paradigm.\nAt the same time, reliable backups are an essential feature for any mass-market messenger.\nTo solve this problem, some applications (like Whatsapp and Viber) allow decryptable backups that put their users' privacy at risk – even if they do not enable backups themselves.\nOther apps ignore the need for backups altogether and fade into oblivion before ever reaching a million users.<\/p>\n<p>We opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats.\nTelegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of Cloud Chats.\nMeanwhile, the separate entity of Secret Chats gives you full control over the data you do not want to be stored.<\/p>\n<p>This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries.\nWe are convinced that the separation of conversations into Cloud and Secret chats represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular messaging application.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Why Telegram isn't End-to-End Encrypted “by Default”<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Your Account\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see my phone number?\n<p>On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number visible.\nBy default, your number is only visible to people who you've added to your address book as contacts.\nYou can further modify this in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\nPhone Number<\/em>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that people will always see your number if they know it already and <strong>saved<\/strong> it in their address book.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: I have a new phone number, what do I do?\n<p>Each phone number is a <strong>separate<\/strong> account on Telegram.\nYou have several options if you are using multiple phone numbers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you will <strong>no longer use the old number<\/strong> (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to Settings and change the number connected to your Telegram account to the new number.\n<strong>Important:<\/strong> make sure you have access to your connected phone number – otherwise you risk losing access to your account.<\/li>\n<li>If you will use the new number for a <strong>limited time<\/strong> (e.g., you're on a trip or vacation), there's no need to do anything.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to keep using <strong>both numbers<\/strong> (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number.\nYou <em>may<\/em> create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated.\nIt is possible to log in to one Telegram app with up to <strong>3<\/strong> different accounts at once.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I log out?\n<p>Most users don't need to log out of Telegram:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Telegram on many devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use the same phone number to log in on all devices.<\/li>\n<li>You can go to <em>Settings &gt.\nData and Storage &gt.\nStorage Usage&gt.\nClear cache<\/em> to <strong>free up space<\/strong> on your device without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram with <strong>multiple phone numbers<\/strong>, you can switch between accounts without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram on a <strong>shared device<\/strong>, you can set up a passcode in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security<\/em> to make sure only you have access to your account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you do want to log out for some reason, here's how you do that:<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nLog out.<br>\n<em>Android<\/em>, <em>Telegram Desktop<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\n… (in the top right corner) &gt.\nLog out.<\/p>\n<p>If

you log out.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that logging out does <strong>not<\/strong> trigger remote deletion of your secret chat messages on your partner's device — to do that, choose 'Clear History' first.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I change my phone number?\n<p>You can change your number in Telegram and keep <strong>everything<\/strong>, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices.<\/p>\n<p>To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then 'Change Number'.\nIf you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account first.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my account?\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account permanently removes all your <strong>messages<\/strong> and <strong>contacts<\/strong>.\nAll groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights.<\/p>\n<p>This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process.<br>Note that you'll receive the <strong>code<\/strong> via <strong>Telegram<\/strong>, not SMS.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What happens if I delete my account?\n<p>As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted.\nThat said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have <em>their<\/em> copy of the messages you sent them.\nSo if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our self-destruct timer instead.<\/p>\n<p>Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible.\nIf you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back.\nPeople, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified.\nThe new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does account self-destruction work?\n<p>Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space greatly.\nIf you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least six months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My phone was stolen, what do I do?\n<p>First of all, sorry about your phone.\nUnfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment.\nWe don't collect additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account.\nThis means we can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number or to Telegram itself on any of your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>I have access to Telegram on another device\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security and turn on Two-Step Verification.\nThis way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account.<\/li>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.\nWhoever has your phone will not be able to log in again, since they don't know your password.<\/li>\n<li>Contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>If you decide to switch to a new phone number, don't forget to go to Settings, tap on your phone number and change your Telegram number to the new one.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>I don't have access to Telegram on any other devices\n<ol>\n<li>First and foremost, you need to contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>Wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Removing sensitive data\n<p>Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn't much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft.\nBut if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to log out the other device, it is best that you wipe it remotely.\nYou can read more about it here: Apple iOS, Android.\nUnfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario.<\/p>\n<p>You can delete your Telegram account if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop).\nNote that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 6 months being the default setting.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Bots\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer, you may find our Bots FAQ more useful.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are bots?\n<p>Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram.\nThey are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a bot?\n<p>Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming.\nIf you're sure you're up to it, our <strong>Introduction for Developers<\/strong> is a good place to start.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer.\nBut we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop?\n<p>If you don't want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as you would block a human user.\nSome Telegram clients have a 'Stop Bot' button right in the bot's profile.<\/p>\n<p>That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its <em>/help<\/em> for clues.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots safe?\n<p>Yes.\nBots are no different from human users that you meet in groups for example.\nThey can see your public name, username, and profile pictures, and they can see messages you send to them, that's it.\nThey can't access your last seen status and <strong>don't<\/strong> see your phone number (unless you decide to give it to them yourself).<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger — don't give them your passwords, Telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely.\nAlso, be careful when opening files sent by bots, same as you would deal with ordinary humans.\nExample: If a bot sent us a file called <em>OpenMe.exe<\/em>, we probably wouldn't open it.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If I add a bot to my group, can it read my messages?\n<p>Bots can work in two modes when you add them to groups.\nBy default, bots only see messages that are meant for them.\nIn this case, you'll see 'has no access to messages' in the group members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Some bots need more information to work, so developers may disable the privacy mode.\nIn this case, the bot will see all messages sent to the group, and you will see 'has access to messages' in the members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about privacy mode for bots »<\/p>\n<p>If your group contains very sensitive information, maybe it's better to avoid adding bots you don't trust 100%.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots made by Telegram?\n<p>No.\nWhile we have some official bots for specific purposes (like @gif or @GDPRbot), we don't usually make bots.\nBots are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API and platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where can I find more bots?\n<p>There is no official store at the moment, so you'll have to ask your friends or search the web for now.\nWe're pretty sure you'll find some bots to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Deeper questions\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not open source everything?\n<p>All code will be released eventually.\nWe started with the most useful parts — a well-documented API that allows developers to build new Telegram apps, and open source clients that can be verified by security specialists.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I run Telegram using my own server?\n<p>Our architecture does not support federation yet.\nTelegram is a unified cloud service, so creating forks where two users might end up on two different Telegram clouds is unacceptable.\nTo enable you to run your own Telegram server while retaining both speed and security is a task in itself.\nAt the moment, we are undecided on whether or not Telegram should go in this direction.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I use the Telegram API?\n<p>Yes.\nDevelopers for all platforms are welcome to use our protocol, API and even source code.\nCheck out the Getting started section of the docs.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't forget about our Bot API that lets you build cool stuff on our platform.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you have a Privacy Policy?\n<p>Sure.\nCheck this out.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why do you have two apps in the Mac App Store?\n<p>One is our app for macOS, the other is Telegram Lite, the macOS version of our multi-platform client.\nBoth apps are official.\nBoth started out as unofficial applications by two different developers and vary in design and functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram for macOS supports many platform-specific features, such as the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, gesture navigation, integration with the Mac's Share menu and more.\nIt has every feature from the iOS version of the app including Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram Lite is a lightning-fast app, optimized for work-related tasks and handling large communities.\nIt offers a three-column interface, perfect for multitasking and quick access to media, files and links shared in your chats.\nThis app can also be used to export your Telegram data and chats.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I translate Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is officially available in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Korean, Malay, Russian and Ukrainian on most platforms, and we are gradually expanding the list of languages built into the apps.<\/p>\n<p>If you don’t like how a specific element in Telegram's interface is translated in your language, or would like to help us maintain the translation, check out our localization platform.\nEveryone can suggest translations and vote for the best ones, making Telegram localization a community-driven effort.<\/p>\n<p>If you're looking to go beyond suggestions for individual phrases and would like to help us maintain the official translation to your language on a continuous basis, you can contact @TelegramAuditions.\nPlease include a hashtag with the English name of your language (e.g.\n#Albanian) and a few links to phrases on this platform with your <strong>translation suggestions<\/strong> or <strong>comments<\/strong>.\nBe sure read the <strong>Style Guide<\/strong> carefully before you apply.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I help?\n<p>Yes, we are always looking for volunteers to help us with user support.\nIf you would be interested in answering questions about Telegram to users from your country, contact our auditions account.<\/p>\n<p>Before you apply, please check out the Telegram Support Initiative.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Passport\n<p>\n<strong>Telegram Passport<\/strong> is a unified authorization method for services that require personal identification.\nWith Telegram Passport, you can upload your documents once, then instantly share your data with services that require real-world ID (finance, ICOs, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>Your identity documents and personal data will be stored in the Telegram cloud using <strong>End-to-End Encryption<\/strong>.\nTo Telegram, this data is just random gibberish, and we have no access to the information you store in your Telegram Passport.\nWhen you share data, it goes directly to the recipient.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can find more information about Telegram Passport on our blog.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer or owner of a service that requires real-life ID, kindly take a look at <strong>this manual<\/strong>.\nYou can also try requesting Telegram Passport data using this page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Troubleshooting\n<i>\n<\/i>Login and SMS\n<p>Please make sure you are entering your mobile phone number in the international format.<br>I.e.: <code>+(country code)(city or carrier code)(your number)<\/code>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are having registration or login problems, please contact us using this form.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Getting a code via a phone call\n<p>For security reasons, login codes dictated via a phone call are only available for accounts that have <strong>two-step verification<\/strong> enabled (Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nTwo-Step Verification).\n<\/p>\n<p>Please also note that Telegram accounts can only be connected to a mobile number.\nWe currently don't support landline numbers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Getting a code via Telegram\n<p>If you have recently used one of our apps on <strong>another device<\/strong> (it could also be a different app on the same device), we may send the login code <strong>via Telegram<\/strong> instead of SMS.<\/p>\n<p>To receive such a code, just check Telegram from any of your connected devices.\nYou will find it in the chat with Telegram, a verified profile with a blue check:<\/p>\n<p>Login code sent via Telegram<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>WARNING!<\/strong> Please note that getting codes via Telegram should not be considered an alternative to using an <strong>up-to-date phone number<\/strong>.\nIn case of a change in numbers, always make sure Telegram is connected to a phone number <strong>you control<\/strong>, otherwise you risk losing access to your account forever.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Notification problems\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the tips below don't help, check out this detailed guide on <strong>Troubleshooting Notification Issues<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>ANDROID<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings — Notifications and Sounds, make sure that notifications are <strong>ON<\/strong> and

names.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you are using the latest version of the app.<\/li>\n<li>Relaunch the app (by terminating it from processes list and launching again).<\/li>\n<li>Temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again).<\/li>\n<li>If that didn't help, re-login.\nRemember that logging out kills your Secret Chats.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Force quit the app (double tap home button, then swipe up on Telegram), then relaunch and check if it helped.<\/li>\n<li>If that

Out.\nRemember that logging out kills all your Secret Chats.\nThen log in again.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Deleting contacts on Android\n<p>To delete a contact, open a chat with the person, tap on their profile photo in the top area of the chat screen, then tap on '…' in the top right corner &gt.\n'Delete'.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete the contact completely, make sure you also delete them from your phone contacts.\nTelegram stays in sync and will add the contact back if you don't.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Where did my Secret Chat messages go?\n<p>Secret Chats are established between the two devices they were created on.\nThis means that all those messages are not available in the cloud and cannot be accessed on other devices.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Secret Chats are also tied to your current login session on the device.\nIf you log out and in again, you will lose all your Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Can't send messages to non-contacts\n<p>When users report unwanted messages from a Telegram account, we apply a limit: Reported accounts can only send messages to people who have their number saved as a contact.<\/p>\n<p>This means that if you randomly contact people you don't know and send them annoying messages, you may lose the ability to do so in the future.<\/p>\n<p>If you think that this limit was applied to your account wrongly, please visit this page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram uses the camera or microphone in the background!\n<p>Telegram can use the <strong>microphone<\/strong> in the background if you minimize the app when making a call, recording a video, or recording a voice/video message.<\/p>\n<p>Permission monitors on Samsung and Xiaomi can inadvertently flag and notify you that Telegram requested access to <strong>camera<\/strong> in the background.\nThis happens when the app requests info about the camera — it isn’t using the camera.\nUnfortunately it may look the same to the Samsung and Xiaomi permission monitors.<\/p>\n<p>Camera info is requested by the app when you tap on the attachment button, or start recording a video or a video message.\nIf you do this and quickly close the app, the already initiated request may try to run asynchronously when the app is already in the background, or be sent when the system wakes up the app to show a notification about a new message.\nIn any case, these requests are only for the camera info, the app <em>never<\/em> uses the camera itself in the background.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can check Telegram’s open source code and confirm that the app is not doing anything behind their back.\nWe also offer reproducible builds that can help you prove that the version you downloaded from App Store or Google Play is built from the exact same source code we publish.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Support\n<p>If you have any other questions, please contact Telegram Support (in Telegram go to Settings — Ask a question).\nNote that we rely on volunteers for

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>12.\nQuestions and concerns\n<p>If you have any questions about privacy and our data policies, please contact our @GDPRbot.\nUse the <em>/access<\/em> command to learn how

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>12.\nQuestions and concerns\n<p>If you have any questions about privacy and our data policies, please contact our @GDPRbot.\nUse the <em>/access<\/em> command to learn how

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via

What do I do here?\n<p>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free.\nYou can use Telegram on all your devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong> — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.<\/p>\n<p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and <strong>files<\/strong> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to <strong>200,000<\/strong> people or channels for broadcasting to <strong>unlimited<\/strong> audiences.\nYou can write to your phone contacts and find people by their <strong>usernames<\/strong>.\nAs a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs.\nIn addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted voice calls.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who is Telegram for?\n<p>Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and calls.\nBusiness users and small teams may like the large groups, usernames, desktop apps and powerful file sharing options.<\/p>\n<p>Since Telegram groups can have up to 200,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient.\nYou can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace.\nPublic groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.<\/p>\n<p>In case you're more into pictures, Telegram has animated gif search, a state of the art photo editor, and an open sticker platform (find some cool stickers here or here).\nWhat's more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device.\nWith Telegram's cloud support and cache management options, Telegram can take up nearly <strong>zero<\/strong> space on your phone.<\/p>\n<p>Those looking for extra privacy should check out our advanced settings and rather revolutionary policy.\nAnd if you want secrecy, try our device-specific Secret Chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional passcode.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We keep evolving — check out the blog and follow us on twitter and Telegram to stay in touch.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?\n<p>Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync.\nAs a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 2 GB <em>each<\/em>.\nAnd if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Telegram is faster and way more secure.\nOn top of that, Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.<\/p>\n<p>Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own Telegram apps.\nWe also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, integrate any services, and even accept payments from users around the world.\n<\/p>\n<p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\nDon't forget to check out this paragraph for even more exclusive stuff.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How old is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram for iOS was launched on August 14, 2013.\nThe alpha version of Telegram for Android officially launched on October 20, 2013.\nMore and more Telegram clients appear, built by independent developers using Telegram's open platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Which devices can I use?\n<p>You can use Telegram on smartphones, tablets, and even computers.\nWe have apps for iOS (9.0 and above), Android (4.1 and up) and Windows Phone.\nYou can also use Telegram's web version or install one of our desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can log in to Telegram from as many of your devices as you like — all <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use your main mobile phone number to log in everywhere.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Our API is open for developers, should you want to build your own applications for other platforms.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is supported by Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai.\nPavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai's input is technological.\nTo make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers.\nAs a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where is Telegram based?\n<p>The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St.\nPetersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of highly skilled engineers.\nThe Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore.\nWe’re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Will you have ads? Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?\n<p>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.<\/p>\n<p>Pavel Durov, who shares our vision, supplied Telegram with a generous donation, so we have quite enough money for the time being.\nIf Telegram runs out, we will introduce non-essential paid options to support the infrastructure and finance developer salaries.\nBut making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?\n<p>Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years.\nTheir marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts from the people around you.\nAdding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities.\nTelegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, without the usual caveats.\nThis means that instead of diverting public attention with low-impact settings, we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What about GDPR?\n<p>New regulations regarding data privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018.\nSince taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn't much we had to change.\nWe don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we're not part of any mafia family “family of companies.”<\/p>\n<p>Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service — for example, your cloud chats so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more information.<\/p>\n<p>You can use <strong>@GDPRbot<\/strong> to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request a copy of all your data that Telegram stores.<\/li>\n<li>Contact us about Data Privacy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Android users got a GDPR update with version 4.8.9 which allows more control over synced contacts and adds other privacy settings.\nOn June, 1, Apple approved Telegram v.4.8.2 for iOS with these features.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: There's illegal content on Telegram.\nHow do I take it down?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.<\/p>\n<p>But <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.\nIf you find sticker sets or bots on Telegram that you think are illegal, please ping us at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the 'report' buttons right inside our apps, see this post on our official @ISISwatch channel for details.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: If a scammer is pretending to be you, contact @NoToScam<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright.\nWhat do I do?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.\nBut <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org.\nPlease note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?\n<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet.\nTo do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal <strong>public<\/strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app.\nFor example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.<\/p>\n<p>User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI.\nWhenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that this does <strong>not<\/strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.\nFor example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship.\nThis goes against our founders' principles.\nWhile we do block terrorist (e.g.\nISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do I do?\n<p>If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you process data requests?\n<p>Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose.<\/p>\n<p>To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure.\nCloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions.\nThe relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect.\nAs a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression.\nTelegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.<\/p>\n<p>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Basics\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can I write to?\n<p>You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram.\nAnother way of contacting people is to type their Telegram username into the search field.<\/p>\n<p>You can set a public username for your Telegram account too.\nOther people will be able to search and find you by that username — and send messages to you even if they don't know your number.\nYou can learn more about usernames here.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I know who in my contacts has Telegram?\n<p>Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts.\nThey also have pictures.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I invite my friends?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> The basic invitations are simple SMS messages.\nThey will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage).\nNaturally, you have other options to bring your friends here.\nTry sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it.\nThe link: <strong>\n<\/strong>\n<strong>https://telegram.org/dl/<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Windows Phone:<\/em> Go to Contacts &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can give your friends a t.me link with your username so that they can easily find you on Telegram even if they don't have your phone number.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do the check marks mean?\n<p>\n<em>One check<\/em> — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.<br>\n<em>Two checks<\/em> — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).<\/p>\n<p>We don't have a 'delivered to device' status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want.\nSo which particular one would that check mean?<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I hide my ‘last seen’ time?\n<p>You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own.\nYou will, however, see an approximate last seen value.\nThis keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram.\nThere are four possible approximate values:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen recently<\/strong> — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a week<\/strong> — between 2-3 and seven days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a month<\/strong> — between 6-7 days and a month<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen a long time ago<\/strong> — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see me 'online'?\n<p>The last seen rules apply to your online status as well.\nPeople can only see you online if you're sharing your last seen status with them.<\/p>\n<p>There are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online.\nRegardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<li>Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.<\/li>\n<li>Broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you're not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don't do anything of the above, they'll never see you online.\nAnother way of achieving this is to block that person.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I delete my messages?\n<p>Yes.\nPreviously, you could unsend your messages within 48 hours after sending them.\nAs of Telegram 5.5, you can always delete any messages you sent or received in <em>any<\/em> one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own messages only).\nYou can also clear the entire chat history on both ends.\nOn Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.<\/p>\n<p>Together with privacy settings for forwarded messages, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder).\nAs a result, our users no longer need to worry about the data accumulating in their chats over the years.\nBoth parties in a conversation now have full control over what does and what doesn't belong to their online identity.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I make calls via Telegram?\n<p>Yes! Voice calls are currently available to users around the world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How can I use emoticons in Telegram on my iOS device?\n<p>We support emoji emoticons.\nSimply enable the Emoji keyboard in your iOS device's Settings (General &gt.\nKeyboards &gt.\nAdd New Keyboard… &gt.\nEmoji).\nThen switch to that keyboard whenever you're out of words.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Groups and Channels\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What makes Telegram groups cool?\n<p>Telegram groups can have up to <strong>200,000 members<\/strong> each and are extremely powerful communication tools.\nHere are a few key features that make them stand out in the messaging world: <\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unified history<\/strong>\n<br>Edit your messages after posting, delete them so that they disappear for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cross-platform availability<\/strong>\n<br>Access your messages anytime, from any number of your mobile or desktop devices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Instant search<\/strong>\n<br>Find the message you're looking for, even among millions.\nFilter by sender to make searching easier.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Replies, mentions, hashtags<\/strong>\n<br>Easily trace a conversation and keep communication efficient, no matter the group size.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Smart notifications<\/strong>\n<br>Mute the group to get notifications only when people mention you or reply to your messages.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pinned messages<\/strong>\n<br>You can pin any message to be displayed at the top of the chat screen.\nAll members will get a notification — even if they muted ordinary messages from your group.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Moderation tools<\/strong>\n<br>Appoint administrators that can mass-delete messages, control membership, and pin important messages.\nDefine their admin privileges with granular precision.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Group permissions<\/strong>\n<br>Set default permissions to restrict all members from posting specific kinds of content.\nOr even restrict members from sending messages altogether – and let the admins chat amongst themselves while everybody else is watching.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>File sharing<\/strong>\n<br>Send and receive files of any type, up to 2 GB in size each, access them instantly on your other devices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Public groups<\/strong>\n<br>Get a short link for your group and make it public, like t.me/publictestgroup.\nThis way, anybody can view the group's entire chat history and join to post messages.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customization via bots<\/strong>\n<br>Create custom tools for any specific needs using our Bot API and Inline Bots.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What's the difference between groups and channels?\n<p>Telegram <strong>groups<\/strong> are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams.\nBut groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members.\nYou can make any group <strong>public<\/strong>, toggle <strong>persistent history<\/strong> to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint <strong>administrators<\/strong> with granular privileges.\nYou can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Channels<\/strong> are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences.\nIn fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers.\nWhen you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your own.\nEach message in a channel has a <strong>view counter<\/strong> that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about channels in the Channels FAQ »<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a group?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Start a new message (tap the icon in the top right corner in Chats) &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Tap the circular pencil icon in the chat list &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:<\/em> Click the menu button in the top left corner &gt.\n'New Group'.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I assign administrators?\n<p>You can add administrators to help you manage your group and define their privileges with granular precision.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Go to Group Info (tap the photo in the top right corner on the group‘s chat screen) &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Go to Group Info (tap the name in the header) &gt.\nthe pencil icon (in the top right corner) &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:<\/em> When in the group, click '…' in the top right corner &gt.\nManage group &gt.\nAdministrators.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I add more members? What's an invite link?\n<p>You can add your contacts, or using search by username.<\/p>\n<p>It is easy to migrate existing groups to Telegram by sending people an <strong>invite link<\/strong>.\nTo create an invite link, go to Group Info &gt.\nAdd Member &gt.\nInvite to Group via Link.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who has Telegram installed will be able to join your group by following this link.\nIf you choose to revoke the link, it will stop working immediately.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about invite links in our blog »<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Usernames and t.me\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are usernames? How do I get one?\n<p>You can set up a <strong>public<\/strong> username on Telegram.\nIt then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username — you will appear in contacts search under 'global results'.\nPlease note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username in Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does t.me work?\n<p>Once you've set up a username, you can give people a t.me/username link.\nOpening that link on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you.\nYou can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.<\/p>\n<p>This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What can I use as my username?\n<p>You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores.\nUsernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g.\nTelegram and TeleGram is the same user).\nThe username must be at least five characters long.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need a username?\n<p>You don't have to get one.\nRemember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number?\n<p>No.\nNeither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your privacy settings).\nThis is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my username?\n<p>Go to Settings and save an empty username.\nThis will remove your username.\npeople will no longer be able to find you via search.\nThis will not affect existing conversations.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do I do if my username is taken?\n<p>Telegram usernames are distributed on a first come — first serve basis.<\/p>\n<p>We understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some of us.\nIf your desired username is already taken, we will be happy to help you acquire it for your account or channel, provided that you have that same username on at least <strong>two<\/strong> of these services: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the fact that one account can register multiple bot and channel usernames, we reserve the right to recall usernames assigned to unused bots and channels, as well as openly squatted usernames.<\/p>\n<p>To request a username, contact @Username_bot.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if someone is pretending to

useful as well.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How secure is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line.\nWe are based on the MTProto protocol (see description and advanced FAQ), built upon time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections.\nWe are continuously working with the community to improve the security of our protocol and clients.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if I’m more paranoid than your regular user?\n<p>We've got you covered.\nTelegram’s special secret chats use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding.\nOn top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: So how do you encrypt data?\n<p>We support two layers of secure encryption.\nServer-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption.\nAll data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files.<\/p>\n<p>Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.\nYou can find more info in the Advanced FAQ.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Do you process data requests?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why should I trust you?\n<p>Telegram is open, anyone can check our source code, protocol and API, see how everything works and make an informed decision.\nTelegram supports verifiable builds, which allow experts to independently verify that our code published on GitHub is the <strong>exact same code<\/strong> that is used to build the apps you download from App Store or Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome security experts to audit our system and appreciate any feedback at security@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, Telegram's primary focus is not to bring a profit, so commercial interests will never interfere with our mission.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need to trust Telegram for this to be secure?\n<p>When it comes to secret chats, you don't — just make sure that the visualized key of your secret chat matches the one in your friend's secret chat settings.\nMore about this below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if my hacker friend says they could decipher Telegram messages?\n<p>Anyone who claims that Telegram messages can be deciphered is welcome to prove that claim in our competition and win $300,000.\nYou can check out the Cracking Contest Description to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>Any comments on Telegram's security are welcome at

depending on the severity of the issue.\nPlease note that we can not offer bounties for issues that are disclosed to the public before they are fixed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can Telegram protect me against everything?\n<p>Telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication.\nThis means that all data (including media and files) that you send and receive via Telegram cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your internet service provider, owners of Wi-Fi routers you connect to, or other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>But please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she takes your unlocked phone without a passcode.\nOr from your IT-department if they access your computer at work.\nOr from any other people that get physical or root access to your phones or computers running Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>If you have reasons to worry about your personal security, we strongly recommend using only Secret Chats in official or at least verifiable open-source apps for sensitive information, preferably with a self-destruct timer.\nWe also recommend enabling 2-Step Verification and setting up a strong passcode to lock your app, you will find both options in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does 2-Step Verification work?\n<p>Logging in with an SMS code is an industry standard in messaging, but if you're looking for more security or have reasons to doubt your mobile carrier or government, we recommend protecting your cloud chats with an additional password.<\/p>\n<p>You can do this in <strong>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\n2-Step Verification<\/strong>.\nOnce enabled, you will need both an SMS code and a password to log in.\nYou can also set up a recovery email address that will help regain access, should you forget your password.\nIf you do so, please remember that it's important that the recovery email account is also protected with a strong password and 2-Step Verification when possible.<\/p>\n<p>Check this out for tips on creating a strong password that is easy to remember.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous?\n<p>Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — root access.<\/p>\n<p>A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the internal storage.\nOnce an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile.\nNo application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Secret Chats\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are secret chats different?\n<p>Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella.\nAll messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (more on this here).\nOn top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats.\nAnd when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well.<\/p>\n<p>You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient.\nThe message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices.<\/p>\n<p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud.\nThis means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin.\nThey are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I start a secret chat?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Open the profile of the user you want to contact.\nTap on ‘…’, then ‘Start Secret Chat’.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Swipe right to open the menu, then 'New secret chat'.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific.\nIf you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device.\nIf you log out, you will lose all your secret chats.\nYou can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do self-destructing messages work?\n<p>The Self-Destruct Timer is available for <strong>all messages<\/strong> in Secret Chats and for <strong>media<\/strong> in private cloud chats.<\/p>\n<p>To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit.\nThe clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets two check marks).\nAs soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from <strong>both<\/strong> devices.\nWe will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent <strong>after<\/strong> the timer was set.\nIt has no effect on earlier messages.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I be certain that my conversation partner doesn't take a screenshot?\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices).\nWe will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently.\nWe advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust.\nAfter all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with a different device or an old school camera.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What is this 'Encryption Key' thing?\n<p>When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\nAfter the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat.\nYou can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app.<\/p>\n<p>Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not just make all chats 'secret'?\n<p>All Telegram messages are always securely encrypted.\nMessages in Secret Chats use <strong>client-client<\/strong> encryption, while Cloud Chats use <strong>client-server/server-client<\/strong> encryption and are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more here).\nThis enables your cloud messages to be both secure and immediately accessible from any of your devices – even if you lose your device altogether.<\/p>\n<p>The problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected device (e.g.\nwhen you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in the end-to-end encryption paradigm.\nAt the same time, reliable backups are an essential feature for any mass-market messenger.\nTo solve this problem, some applications (like Whatsapp and Viber) allow decryptable backups that put their users' privacy at risk – even if they do not enable backups themselves.\nOther apps ignore the need for backups altogether and fade into oblivion before ever reaching a million users.<\/p>\n<p>We opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats.\nTelegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of Cloud Chats.\nMeanwhile, the separate entity of Secret Chats gives you full control over the data you do not want to be stored.<\/p>\n<p>This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries.\nWe are convinced that the separation of conversations into Cloud and Secret chats represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular messaging application.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Why Telegram isn't End-to-End Encrypted “by

number for a <strong>limited time<\/strong> (e.g., you're on a trip or vacation), there's no need to do anything.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to keep using <strong>both numbers<\/strong> (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number.\nYou <em>may<\/em> create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated.\nIt is possible to log in to one Telegram app with up to <strong>3<\/strong> different accounts at once.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I log out?\n<p>Most users don't need to log out of Telegram:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Telegram on many devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use the same phone number to log in on all devices.<\/li>\n<li>You can go to <em>Settings &gt.\nData and Storage &gt.\nStorage Usage&gt.\nClear cache<\/em> to <strong>free up space<\/strong> on your device without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram with <strong>multiple phone numbers<\/strong>, you can switch between accounts without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram on a <strong>shared device<\/strong>, you can set up a passcode in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security<\/em> to make sure only you have access to your account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you do want to log out for some reason, here's how you do that:<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nLog out.<br>\n<em>Android<\/em>, <em>Telegram Desktop<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\n… (in the top right corner) &gt.\nLog out.<\/p>\n<p>If you log out, you will keep all your cloud messages.\nHowever, you <strong>will lose<\/strong> all your <strong>Secret Chats<\/strong> and <strong>all messages<\/strong> inside those secret chats when you log out.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that logging out does <strong>not<\/strong> trigger remote deletion of your secret chat messages on your partner's device — to do that, choose 'Clear History' first.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I change my phone number?\n<p>You can change your number in Telegram and keep <strong>everything<\/strong>, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices.<\/p>\n<p>To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then 'Change Number'.\nIf you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account first.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my account?\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account permanently removes all your <strong>messages<\/strong> and <strong>contacts<\/strong>.\nAll groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights.<\/p>\n<p>This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process.<br>Note that you'll receive the <strong>code<\/strong> via <strong>Telegram<\/strong>, not SMS.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What happens if I delete my account?\n<p>As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted.\nThat said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have <em>their<\/em> copy of the messages you sent them.\nSo if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our self-destruct timer instead.<\/p>\n<p>Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible.\nIf you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back.\nPeople, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified.\nThe new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does account self-destruction work?\n<p>Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space greatly.\nIf you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least six months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My phone was stolen, what do I do?\n<p>First of all, sorry about your phone.\nUnfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment.\nWe don't collect additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account.\nThis means we can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number or to Telegram itself on any of your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>I have access to Telegram on another device\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security and turn on Two-Step Verification.\nThis way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account.<\/li>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.\nWhoever has your phone will not be able to log in again, since they don't know your password.<\/li>\n<li>Contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>If you decide to switch to a new phone number, don't forget to go to Settings, tap on your phone number and change your Telegram number to the new one.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>I don't have access to Telegram on any other devices\n<ol>\n<li>First and foremost, you need to contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>Wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Removing sensitive data\n<p>Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn't much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft.\nBut if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to log out the other device, it is best that you wipe it remotely.\nYou can read more about it here: Apple iOS, Android.\nUnfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario.<\/p>\n<p>You can delete your Telegram account if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop).\nNote that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 6 months being the default setting.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Bots\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer, you may find our Bots FAQ more useful.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are bots?\n<p>Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram.\nThey are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a bot?\n<p>Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming.\nIf you're sure you're up to it, our <strong>Introduction for Developers<\/strong> is a good place to start.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer.\nBut we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop?\n<p>If you don't want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as you would block a human user.\nSome Telegram clients have a 'Stop Bot' button right in the bot's profile.<\/p>\n<p>That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its <em>/help<\/em> for clues.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots safe?\n<p>Yes.\nBots are no different from human users that you meet in groups for example.\nThey can see your public name, username, and profile pictures, and they can see messages you send to them, that's it.\nThey can't access your last seen status and <strong>don't<\/strong> see your phone number (unless you decide to give it to them yourself).<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger — don't give them your passwords, Telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely.\nAlso, be careful when opening files sent by bots, same as you would deal with ordinary humans.\nExample: If a bot sent us a file called <em>OpenMe.exe<\/em>, we probably wouldn't open it.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If I add a bot to my group, can it read my messages?\n<p>Bots can work in two modes when you add them to groups.\nBy default, bots only see messages that are meant for them.\nIn this case, you'll see 'has no access to messages' in the group members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Some bots need more information to work, so developers may disable the privacy mode.\nIn this case, the bot will see all messages sent to the group, and you will see 'has access to messages' in the members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about privacy mode for bots »<\/p>\n<p>If your group contains very sensitive information, maybe it's better to avoid adding bots you don't trust 100%.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots made by Telegram?\n<p>No.\nWhile we have some official bots for specific purposes (like @gif or @GDPRbot), we don't usually make bots.\nBots are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API and platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where can I find more bots?\n<p>There is no official store at the moment, so you'll have to ask your friends or search the web for now.\nWe're pretty sure you'll find some bots to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Deeper questions\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not open source everything?\n<p>All code will be released eventually.\nWe started with the most useful parts — a well-documented API that allows developers to build new Telegram apps, and open source clients that can be verified by security specialists.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I run Telegram using my own server?\n<p>Our architecture does not support federation yet.\nTelegram is a unified cloud service, so creating forks where two users might end up on two different Telegram clouds is unacceptable.\nTo enable you to run your own Telegram server while retaining both speed and security is a task in itself.\nAt the moment, we are undecided on whether or not Telegram should go in this direction.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I use the Telegram API?\n<p>Yes.\nDevelopers for all platforms are welcome to use our protocol, API and even source code.\nCheck out the Getting started section of the docs.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't forget about our Bot API that lets you build cool stuff on our platform.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you have a Privacy Policy?\n<p>Sure.\nCheck this out.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why do you have two apps in the Mac App Store?\n<p>One is our app for macOS, the other is Telegram Lite, the macOS version of our multi-platform client.\nBoth apps are official.\nBoth started out as unofficial applications by two different developers and vary in design and functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram for macOS supports many platform-specific features, such as the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, gesture navigation, integration with the Mac's Share menu and more.\nIt has every feature from the iOS version of the app including Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram Lite is a lightning-fast app, optimized for work-related tasks and handling large communities.\nIt offers a three-column interface, perfect for multitasking and quick access to media, files and links shared in your chats.\nThis app can also be used to export your Telegram data and chats.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I translate Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is officially available in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Korean, Malay, Russian and Ukrainian on most platforms, and we are gradually expanding the list of languages built into the apps.<\/p>\n<p>If you don’t like how a specific element in Telegram's interface is translated in your language, or would like to help us maintain the translation, check out our localization platform.\nEveryone can suggest translations and vote for the best ones, making Telegram localization a community-driven effort.<\/p>\n<p>If you're looking to go beyond suggestions for individual phrases and would like to help us maintain the official translation to your language on a continuous basis, you can contact @TelegramAuditions.\nPlease include a hashtag with the English name of your language (e.g.\n#Albanian) and a few links to phrases on this platform with your <strong>translation suggestions<\/strong> or <strong>comments<\/strong>.\nBe sure read the <strong>Style Guide<\/strong> carefully before you apply.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I help?\n<p>Yes, we are always looking for volunteers to help us with user support.\nIf you would be interested in answering questions about Telegram to users from your country, contact our auditions account.<\/p>\n<p>Before you apply, please check out the Telegram Support Initiative.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Passport\n<p>\n<strong>Telegram Passport<\/strong> is a unified authorization method for services that require personal identification.\nWith Telegram Passport, you can upload your documents once, then instantly share your data with services that require real-world ID (finance, ICOs, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>Your identity documents and personal data will be stored in the Telegram cloud using <strong>End-to-End Encryption<\/strong>.\nTo Telegram, this data is just random gibberish, and we have no access to the information you store in your Telegram Passport.\nWhen you share data, it goes directly to the recipient.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can find more information about Telegram Passport on our blog.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer or owner of a

Telegram\n<p>If you have recently used one of our apps on <strong>another device<\/strong> (it could also be a different app on the same device), we may send the login code <strong>via Telegram<\/strong> instead of SMS.<\/p>\n<p>To receive such a code, just check Telegram from any of your connected devices.\nYou will find it in the chat with Telegram, a verified profile with a blue check:<\/p>\n<p>Login code sent via Telegram<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>WARNING!<\/strong> Please note that getting codes via Telegram should not be considered an alternative to using an <strong>up-to-date

their profile photo in the top area of the chat screen, then tap on '…' in the top right corner &gt.\n'Delete'.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete the contact completely, make sure you also delete them from your phone contacts.\nTelegram stays in sync and will add the contact back if you don't.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Where did my Secret Chat messages go?\n<p>Secret Chats are established between the two devices they were created on.\nThis means that all those messages are not available in the cloud and cannot be accessed on other devices.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Secret Chats are also tied to your current login session on the device.\nIf you log out and in again, you will lose all your Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Can't send messages to non-contacts\n<p>When users report unwanted messages from a Telegram account, we apply a limit: Reported accounts can only send messages to people who have their number saved as a contact.<\/p>\n<p>This means that if you randomly contact people you don't know and send them annoying messages, you may lose the ability to do so in the future.<\/p>\n<p>If you think that this limit was applied to your account wrongly, please visit this page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram uses the camera or microphone in the background!\n<p>Telegram can use the <strong>microphone<\/strong> in the background if you minimize the app when making a call, recording a video, or recording a voice/video message.<\/p>\n<p>Permission monitors on Samsung and Xiaomi can inadvertently flag and notify you that Telegram requested access to <strong>camera<\/strong> in the background.\nThis happens when the app requests info about the camera — it isn’t using the camera.\nUnfortunately it may look the same to the Samsung and Xiaomi permission monitors.<\/p>\n<p>Camera info is requested by the app when you tap on the attachment button, or start recording a video or a video message.\nIf you do this and quickly close the app, the already initiated request may try to run asynchronously when the app is already in the background, or be sent when the system wakes up the app to show a notification about a new message.\nIn any case, these requests are only for the camera info, the app <em>never<\/em> uses the camera itself in the background.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can check Telegram’s open source code and confirm that the app is not doing anything behind their back.\nWe also offer reproducible builds that can help you prove that the version you downloaded from App Store or Google Play is built from the exact same source code we publish.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Support\n<p>If you have any other questions, please contact Telegram Support (in Telegram go to Settings — Ask a question).\nNote that we rely on volunteers for

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>12.\nQuestions and concerns\n<p>If you have any questions about privacy and our data policies, please contact our @GDPRbot.\nUse the <em>/access<\/em> command to learn how

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>12.\nQuestions and concerns\n<p>If you have any questions about privacy and our data policies, please contact our @GDPRbot.\nUse the <em>/access<\/em> command to learn how

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this page <strong>www.telegram.org/privacy<\/strong>.\nPlease check our website frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy, a summary of which we will set out below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>March 25, 2019<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expanded [10.2.\nDeleting Messages] with data on the new features in version 5.5, which allow both participants to remove any messages from one-on-one chats for both sides without a time limit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Important changes made to this Privacy Policy will be notified to you via

What do I do here?\n<p>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free.\nYou can use Telegram on all your devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong> — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.<\/p>\n<p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and <strong>files<\/strong> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to <strong>200,000<\/strong> people or channels for broadcasting to <strong>unlimited<\/strong> audiences.\nYou can write to your phone contacts and find people by their <strong>usernames<\/strong>.\nAs a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs.\nIn addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted voice calls.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who is Telegram for?\n<p>Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and calls.\nBusiness users and small teams may like the large groups, usernames, desktop apps and powerful file sharing options.<\/p>\n<p>Since Telegram groups can have up to 200,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient.\nYou can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace.\nPublic groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.<\/p>\n<p>In case you're more into pictures, Telegram has animated gif search, a state of the art photo editor, and an open sticker platform (find some cool stickers here or here).\nWhat's more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device.\nWith Telegram's cloud support and cache management options, Telegram can take up nearly <strong>zero<\/strong> space on your phone.<\/p>\n<p>Those looking for extra privacy should check out our advanced settings and rather revolutionary policy.\nAnd if you want secrecy, try our device-specific Secret Chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional passcode.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We keep evolving — check out the blog and follow us on twitter and Telegram to stay in touch.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?\n<p>Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync.\nAs a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 2 GB <em>each<\/em>.\nAnd if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Telegram is faster and way more secure.\nOn top of that, Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.<\/p>\n<p>Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own Telegram apps.\nWe also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, integrate any services, and even accept payments from users around the world.\n<\/p>\n<p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\nDon't forget to check out this paragraph for even more exclusive stuff.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How old is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram for iOS was launched on August 14, 2013.\nThe alpha version of Telegram for Android officially launched on October 20, 2013.\nMore and more Telegram clients appear, built by independent developers using Telegram's open platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Which devices can I use?\n<p>You can use Telegram on smartphones, tablets, and even computers.\nWe have apps for iOS (9.0 and above), Android (4.1 and up) and Windows Phone.\nYou can also use Telegram's web version or install one of our desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can log in to Telegram from as many of your devices as you like — all <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use your main mobile phone number to log in everywhere.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Our API is open for developers, should you want to build your own applications for other platforms.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is supported by Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai.\nPavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai's input is technological.\nTo make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers.\nAs a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where is Telegram based?\n<p>The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St.\nPetersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of highly skilled engineers.\nThe Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore.\nWe’re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Will you have ads? Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?\n<p>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.<\/p>\n<p>Pavel Durov, who shares our vision, supplied Telegram with a generous donation, so we have quite enough money for the time being.\nIf Telegram runs out, we will introduce non-essential paid options to support the infrastructure and finance developer salaries.\nBut making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?\n<p>Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years.\nTheir marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts from the people around you.\nAdding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities.\nTelegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, without the usual caveats.\nThis means that instead of diverting public attention with low-impact settings, we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What about GDPR?\n<p>New regulations regarding data privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018.\nSince taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn't much we had to change.\nWe don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we're not part of any mafia family “family of companies.”<\/p>\n<p>Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service — for example, your cloud chats so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more information.<\/p>\n<p>You can use <strong>@GDPRbot<\/strong> to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request a copy of all your data that Telegram stores.<\/li>\n<li>Contact us about Data Privacy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Android users got a GDPR update with version 4.8.9 which allows more control over synced contacts and adds other privacy settings.\nOn June, 1, Apple approved Telegram v.4.8.2 for iOS with these features.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: There's illegal content on Telegram.\nHow do I take it down?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.<\/p>\n<p>But <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.\nIf you find sticker sets or bots on Telegram that you think are illegal, please ping us at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the 'report' buttons right inside our apps, see this post on our official @ISISwatch channel for details.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: If a scammer is pretending to be you, contact @NoToScam<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright.\nWhat do I do?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.\nBut <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org.\nPlease note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?\n<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet.\nTo do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal <strong>public<\/strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app.\nFor example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.<\/p>\n<p>User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI.\nWhenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that this does <strong>not<\/strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.\nFor example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship.\nThis goes against our founders' principles.\nWhile we do block terrorist (e.g.\nISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do I do?\n<p>If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you process data requests?\n<p>Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose.<\/p>\n<p>To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure.\nCloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions.\nThe relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect.\nAs a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression.\nTelegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.<\/p>\n<p>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Basics\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can I write to?\n<p>You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram.\nAnother way of contacting people is to type their Telegram username into the search field.<\/p>\n<p>You can set a public username for your Telegram account too.\nOther people will be able to search and find you by that username — and send messages to you even if they don't know your number.\nYou can learn more about usernames here.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I know who in my contacts has Telegram?\n<p>Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts.\nThey also have pictures.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I invite my friends?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> The basic invitations are simple SMS messages.\nThey will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage).\nNaturally, you have other options to bring your friends here.\nTry sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it.\nThe link: <strong>\n<\/strong>\n<strong>https://telegram.org/dl/<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Windows Phone:<\/em> Go to Contacts &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can give your friends a t.me link with your username so that they can easily find you on Telegram even if they don't have your phone number.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do the check marks mean?\n<p>\n<em>One check<\/em> — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.<br>\n<em>Two checks<\/em> — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).<\/p>\n<p>We don't have a 'delivered to device' status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want.\nSo which particular one would that check mean?<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I hide my ‘last seen’ time?\n<p>You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own.\nYou will, however, see an approximate last seen value.\nThis keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram.\nThere are four possible approximate values:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen recently<\/strong> — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a week<\/strong> — between 2-3 and seven days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a month<\/strong> — between 6-7 days and a month<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen a long time ago<\/strong> — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see me 'online'?\n<p>The last seen rules apply to your online status as well.\nPeople can only see you online if you're sharing your last seen status with them.<\/p>\n<p>There are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online.\nRegardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<li>Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.<\/li>\n<li>Broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you're not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don't do anything of the above, they'll never see you online.\nAnother way of achieving this is to block that person.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I delete my messages?\n<p>Yes.\nPreviously, you could unsend your messages within 48 hours after sending them.\nAs of Telegram 5.5, you can always delete any messages you sent or received in <em>any<\/em> one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own messages only).\nYou can also clear the entire chat history on both ends.\nOn Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.<\/p>\n<p>Together with privacy settings for forwarded messages, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder).\nAs a result, our users no longer need to worry about the data accumulating in their chats over the years.\nBoth parties in a conversation now have full control over what does and what doesn't belong to their online identity.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I make calls via Telegram?\n<p>Yes! Voice calls are currently available to users around the world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How can I use emoticons in Telegram on my iOS device?\n<p>We support emoji emoticons.\nSimply enable the Emoji keyboard in your iOS device's Settings (General &gt.\nKeyboards &gt.\nAdd New Keyboard… &gt.\nEmoji).\nThen switch to that keyboard whenever you're out of words.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Groups and Channels\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What makes Telegram groups cool?\n<p>Telegram groups can have up to <strong>200,000 members<\/strong> each and are extremely powerful communication tools.\nHere are a few key features that make them stand out in the messaging world: <\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unified history<\/strong>\n<br>Edit your messages after posting, delete them so that they disappear for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cross-platform availability<\/strong>\n<br>Access your messages anytime, from any number of your mobile or desktop devices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Instant search<\/strong>\n<br>Find the message you're looking for, even among millions.\nFilter by sender to make searching easier.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Replies, mentions, hashtags<\/strong>\n<br>Easily trace a conversation and keep communication efficient, no matter the group size.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Smart notifications<\/strong>\n<br>Mute the group to get notifications only when people mention you or reply to your messages.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pinned messages<\/strong>\n<br>You can pin any message to be displayed at the top of the chat screen.\nAll members will get a notification — even if they muted ordinary messages from your group.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Moderation tools<\/strong>\n<br>Appoint administrators that can mass-delete messages, control membership, and pin important messages.\nDefine their admin privileges with granular precision.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Group permissions<\/strong>\n<br>Set default permissions to restrict all members from posting specific kinds of content.\nOr even restrict members from sending messages altogether – and let the admins chat amongst themselves while everybody else is watching.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>File sharing<\/strong>\n<br>Send and receive files of any type, up to 2 GB in size each, access them instantly on your other devices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Public groups<\/strong>\n<br>Get a short link for your group and make it public, like t.me/publictestgroup.\nThis way, anybody can view the group's entire chat history and join to post messages.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customization via bots<\/strong>\n<br>Create custom tools for any specific needs using our Bot API and Inline Bots.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What's the difference between groups and channels?\n<p>Telegram <strong>groups<\/strong> are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams.\nBut groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members.\nYou can make any group <strong>public<\/strong>, toggle <strong>persistent history<\/strong> to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint <strong>administrators<\/strong> with granular privileges.\nYou can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Channels<\/strong> are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences.\nIn fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers.\nWhen you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your own.\nEach message in a channel has a <strong>view counter<\/strong> that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about channels in the Channels FAQ »<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a group?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Start a new message (tap the icon in the top right corner in Chats) &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Tap the circular pencil icon in the chat list &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:<\/em> Click the menu button in the top left corner &gt.\n'New Group'.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I assign administrators?\n<p>You can add administrators to help you manage your group and define their privileges with granular precision.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Go to Group Info (tap the photo in the top right corner on the group‘s chat screen) &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Go to Group Info (tap the name in the header) &gt.\nthe pencil icon (in the top right corner) &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:<\/em> When in the group, click '…' in the top right corner &gt.\nManage group &gt.\nAdministrators.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I add more members? What's an invite link?\n<p>You can add your contacts, or using search by username.<\/p>\n<p>It is easy to migrate existing groups to Telegram by sending people an <strong>invite link<\/strong>.\nTo create an invite link, go to Group Info &gt.\nAdd Member &gt.\nInvite to Group via Link.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who has Telegram installed will be able to join your group by following this link.\nIf you choose to revoke the link, it will stop working immediately.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about invite links in our blog »<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Usernames and t.me\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are usernames? How do I get one?\n<p>You can set up a <strong>public<\/strong> username on Telegram.\nIt then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username — you will appear in contacts search under 'global results'.\nPlease note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username in Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does t.me work?\n<p>Once you've set up a username, you can give people a t.me/username link.\nOpening that link on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you.\nYou can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.<\/p>\n<p>This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What can I use as my username?\n<p>You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores.\nUsernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g.\nTelegram and TeleGram is the same user).\nThe username must be at least five characters long.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need a username?\n<p>You don't have to get one.\nRemember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number?\n<p>No.\nNeither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your privacy settings).\nThis is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my username?\n<p>Go to Settings and save an empty username.\nThis will remove your username.\npeople will no longer be able to find you via search.\nThis will not affect existing conversations.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do I do if my username is taken?\n<p>Telegram usernames are distributed on a first come — first serve basis.<\/p>\n<p>We understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some of us.\nIf your desired username is already taken, we will be happy to help you acquire it for your account or channel, provided that you have that same username on at least <strong>two<\/strong> of these services: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the fact that one account can register multiple bot and channel usernames, we reserve the right to recall usernames assigned to unused bots and channels, as well as openly squatted usernames.<\/p>\n<p>To request a username, contact @Username_bot.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if someone is pretending to be me?\n<p>If a scammer is pretending to be you, please contact @NoToScam.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Security\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are an advanced user, you may find our FAQ for the Technically Inclined useful as well.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How secure is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line.\nWe are based on the MTProto protocol (see description and advanced FAQ), built upon time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections.\nWe are continuously working with the community to improve the security of our protocol and clients.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if I’m more paranoid than your regular user?\n<p>We've got you covered.\nTelegram’s special secret chats use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding.\nOn top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: So how do you encrypt data?\n<p>We support two layers of secure encryption.\nServer-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption.\nAll data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files.<\/p>\n<p>Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.\nYou can find more info in the Advanced FAQ.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Do you process data requests?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why should I trust you?\n<p>Telegram is open, anyone can check our source code, protocol and API, see how everything works and make an informed decision.\nTelegram supports verifiable builds, which allow experts to independently verify that our code published on GitHub is the <strong>exact same code<\/strong> that is used to build the apps you download from App Store or Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome security experts to audit our system and appreciate any feedback at security@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, Telegram's primary focus is not to bring a profit, so commercial interests will never interfere with our mission.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need to trust Telegram for this to be secure?\n<p>When it comes to secret chats, you don't — just make sure that the visualized key of your secret chat matches the one in your friend's secret chat settings.\nMore about this below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if my hacker friend says they could decipher Telegram messages?\n<p>Anyone who claims that Telegram messages can be deciphered is welcome to prove that claim in our competition and win $300,000.\nYou can check out the Cracking Contest Description to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>Any comments on Telegram's security are welcome at security@telegram.org.\nAll submissions which result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging from <strong>$100<\/strong> to <strong>$100,000<\/strong> or more, depending on the severity of the issue.\nPlease note that we can not offer bounties for issues that are disclosed to the public before they are fixed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can Telegram protect me against everything?\n<p>Telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication.\nThis means that all data (including media and files) that you send and receive via Telegram cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your internet service provider, owners of Wi-Fi routers you connect to, or other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>But please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she takes your unlocked phone without a passcode.\nOr from your IT-department if they access your computer at work.\nOr from any other people that get physical or root access to your phones or computers running Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>If you have reasons to worry about your personal security, we strongly recommend using only Secret Chats in official or at least verifiable open-source apps for sensitive information, preferably with a self-destruct timer.\nWe also recommend enabling 2-Step Verification and setting up a strong passcode to lock your app, you will find both options in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does 2-Step Verification work?\n<p>Logging in with an SMS code is an industry standard in messaging, but if you're looking for more security or have reasons to doubt your mobile carrier or government, we recommend protecting your cloud chats with an additional password.<\/p>\n<p>You can do this in <strong>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\n2-Step Verification<\/strong>.\nOnce enabled, you will need both an SMS code and a password to log in.\nYou can also set up a recovery email address that will help regain access, should you forget your password.\nIf you do so, please remember that it's important that the recovery email account is also protected with a strong password and 2-Step Verification when possible.<\/p>\n<p>Check this out for tips on creating a strong password that is easy to remember.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous?\n<p>Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — root access.<\/p>\n<p>A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the internal storage.\nOnce an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile.\nNo application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Secret Chats\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are secret chats different?\n<p>Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella.\nAll messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (more on this here).\nOn top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats.\nAnd when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well.<\/p>\n<p>You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient.\nThe message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices.<\/p>\n<p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud.\nThis means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin.\nThey are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I start a secret chat?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Open the profile of the user you want to contact.\nTap on ‘…’, then ‘Start Secret Chat’.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Swipe right to open the menu, then 'New secret chat'.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific.\nIf you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device.\nIf you log out, you will lose all your secret chats.\nYou can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do self-destructing messages work?\n<p>The Self-Destruct Timer is available for <strong>all messages<\/strong> in Secret Chats and for <strong>media<\/strong> in private cloud chats.<\/p>\n<p>To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit.\nThe clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets two check marks).\nAs soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from <strong>both<\/strong> devices.\nWe will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent <strong>after<\/strong> the timer was set.\nIt has no effect on earlier messages.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I be certain that my conversation partner doesn't take a screenshot?\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices).\nWe will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently.\nWe advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust.\nAfter all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with a different device or an old school camera.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What is this 'Encryption Key' thing?\n<p>When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\nAfter the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat.\nYou can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app.<\/p>\n<p>Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not just make all chats 'secret'?\n<p>All Telegram messages are always securely encrypted.\nMessages in Secret Chats use <strong>client-client<\/strong> encryption, while Cloud Chats use <strong>client-server/server-client<\/strong> encryption and are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more here).\nThis enables your cloud messages to be both secure and immediately accessible from any of your devices – even if you lose your device altogether.<\/p>\n<p>The problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected device (e.g.\nwhen you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in the end-to-end encryption paradigm.\nAt the same time, reliable backups are an essential feature for any mass-market messenger.\nTo solve this problem, some applications (like Whatsapp and Viber) allow decryptable backups that put their users' privacy at risk – even if they do not enable backups themselves.\nOther apps ignore the need for backups altogether and fade into oblivion before ever reaching a million users.<\/p>\n<p>We opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats.\nTelegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of Cloud Chats.\nMeanwhile, the separate entity of Secret Chats gives you full control over the data you do not want to be stored.<\/p>\n<p>This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries.\nWe are convinced that the separation of conversations into Cloud and Secret chats represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular messaging application.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Why Telegram isn't End-to-End Encrypted “by Default”<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Your Account\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see my phone number?\n<p>On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number visible.\nBy default, your number is only visible to people who you've added to your address book as contacts.\nYou can further modify this in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\nPhone Number<\/em>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that people will always see your number if they know it already and <strong>saved<\/strong> it in their address book.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: I have a new phone number, what do I do?\n<p>Each phone number is a <strong>separate<\/strong> account on Telegram.\nYou have several options if you are using multiple phone numbers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you will <strong>no longer use the old number<\/strong> (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to Settings and change the number connected to your Telegram account to the new number.\n<strong>Important:<\/strong> make sure you have access to your connected phone number – otherwise you risk losing access to your account.<\/li>\n<li>If you will use the new number for a <strong>limited time<\/strong> (e.g., you're on a trip or vacation), there's no need to do anything.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to keep using <strong>both numbers<\/strong> (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number.\nYou <em>may<\/em> create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated.\nIt is possible to log in to one Telegram app with up to <strong>3<\/strong> different accounts at once.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I log out?\n<p>Most users don't need to log out of Telegram:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Telegram on many devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use the same phone number to log in on all devices.<\/li>\n<li>You can go to <em>Settings &gt.\nData and Storage &gt.\nStorage Usage&gt.\nClear cache<\/em> to <strong>free up space<\/strong> on your device without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram with <strong>multiple phone numbers<\/strong>, you can switch between accounts without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram on a <strong>shared device<\/strong>, you can set up a passcode in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security<\/em> to make sure only you have access to your account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you do want to log out for some reason, here's how you do that:<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nLog out.<br>\n<em>Android<\/em>, <em>Telegram Desktop<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\n… (in the top right corner) &gt.\nLog out.<\/p>\n<p>If you log out, you will keep all your cloud messages.\nHowever, you <strong>will lose<\/strong> all your <strong>Secret Chats<\/strong> and <strong>all messages<\/strong> inside those secret chats when you log out.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that logging out does <strong>not<\/strong> trigger remote deletion of your secret chat messages on your partner's device — to do that, choose 'Clear History' first.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I change my phone number?\n<p>You can change your number in Telegram and keep <strong>everything<\/strong>, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices.<\/p>\n<p>To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then 'Change Number'.\nIf you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account first.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my account?\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account permanently removes all your <strong>messages<\/strong> and <strong>contacts<\/strong>.\nAll groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights.<\/p>\n<p>This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process.<br>Note that you'll receive the <strong>code<\/strong> via <strong>Telegram<\/strong>, not SMS.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What happens if I delete my account?\n<p>As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted.\nThat said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have <em>their<\/em> copy of the messages you sent them.\nSo if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our self-destruct timer instead.<\/p>\n<p>Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible.\nIf you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back.\nPeople, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified.\nThe new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does account self-destruction work?\n<p>Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space greatly.\nIf you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least six months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My phone was stolen, what do I do?\n<p>First of all, sorry about your phone.\nUnfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment.\nWe don't collect additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account.\nThis means we can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number or to Telegram itself on any of your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>I have access to Telegram on another device\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security and turn on Two-Step Verification.\nThis way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account.<\/li>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.\nWhoever has your phone will not be able to log in again, since they don't know your password.<\/li>\n<li>Contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>If you decide to switch to a new phone number, don't forget to go to Settings, tap on your phone number and change your Telegram number to the new one.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>I don't have access to Telegram on any other devices\n<ol>\n<li>First and foremost, you need to contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>Wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Removing sensitive data\n<p>Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn't much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft.\nBut if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to log out the other device, it is best that you wipe it remotely.\nYou can read more about it here: Apple iOS, Android.\nUnfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario.<\/p>\n<p>You can delete your Telegram account if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop).\nNote that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 6 months being the default setting.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Bots\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer, you may find our Bots FAQ more useful.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are bots?\n<p>Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram.\nThey are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a bot?\n<p>Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming.\nIf you're sure you're up to it, our <strong>Introduction for Developers<\/strong> is a good place to start.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer.\nBut we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop?\n<p>If you don't want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as you would block a human user.\nSome Telegram clients have a 'Stop Bot' button right in the bot's profile.<\/p>\n<p>That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its <em>/help<\/em> for clues.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots safe?\n<p>Yes.\nBots are no different from human users that you meet in groups for example.\nThey can see your public name, username, and profile pictures, and they can see messages you send to them, that's it.\nThey can't access your last seen status and <strong>don't<\/strong> see your phone number (unless you decide to give it to them yourself).<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger — don't give them your passwords, Telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely.\nAlso, be careful when opening files sent by bots, same as you would deal with ordinary humans.\nExample: If a bot sent us a file called <em>OpenMe.exe<\/em>, we probably wouldn't open it.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If I add a bot to my group, can it read my messages?\n<p>Bots can work in two modes when you add them to groups.\nBy default, bots only see messages that are meant for them.\nIn this case, you'll see 'has no access to messages' in the group members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Some bots need more information to work, so developers may disable the privacy mode.\nIn this case, the bot will see all messages sent to the group, and you will see 'has access to messages' in the members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about privacy mode for bots »<\/p>\n<p>If your group contains very sensitive information, maybe it's better to avoid adding bots you don't trust 100%.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots made by Telegram?\n<p>No.\nWhile we have some official bots for specific purposes (like @gif or @GDPRbot), we don't usually make bots.\nBots are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API and platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where can I find more bots?\n<p>There is no official store at the moment, so you'll have to ask your friends or search the web for now.\nWe're pretty sure you'll find some bots to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Deeper questions\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not open source everything?\n<p>All code will be released eventually.\nWe started with the most useful parts — a well-documented API that allows developers to build new Telegram apps, and open source clients that can be verified by security specialists.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I run Telegram using my own server?\n<p>Our architecture does not support federation yet.\nTelegram is a unified cloud service, so creating forks where two users might end up on two different Telegram clouds is unacceptable.\nTo enable you to run your own Telegram server while retaining both speed and security is a task in itself.\nAt the moment, we are undecided on whether or not Telegram should go in this direction.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I use the Telegram API?\n<p>Yes.\nDevelopers for all platforms are welcome to use our protocol, API and even source code.\nCheck out the Getting started section of the docs.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't forget about our Bot API that lets you build cool stuff on our

the other is Telegram Lite, the macOS version of our multi-platform client.\nBoth apps are official.\nBoth started out as unofficial applications by two different developers and vary in design and functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram for macOS supports many platform-specific features, such as the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, gesture navigation, integration with the Mac's Share menu and more.\nIt has every feature from the iOS version of the app including Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram Lite is a lightning-fast app, optimized for work-related tasks and handling large communities.\nIt offers a

their profile photo in the top area of the chat screen, then tap on '…' in the top right corner &gt.\n'Delete'.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete the contact completely, make sure you also delete them from your phone contacts.\nTelegram stays in sync and will add the contact back if you don't.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Where did my Secret Chat messages go?\n<p>Secret Chats are established between the two devices they were created on.\nThis means that all those messages are not available in the cloud and cannot be accessed on other devices.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Secret Chats are also tied to your current login session on the device.\nIf you log out and in again, you will lose all your Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Can't send messages to non-contacts\n<p>When users report unwanted messages from a Telegram account, we apply a limit: Reported accounts can only send messages to people who have their number saved as a contact.<\/p>\n<p>This means that if you randomly contact people you don't know and send them annoying messages, you may lose the ability to do so in the future.<\/p>\n<p>If you think that this limit was applied to your account wrongly, please visit this page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram uses the camera or microphone in the background!\n<p>Telegram can use the <strong>microphone<\/strong> in the background if you minimize the app when making a call, recording a video, or recording a voice/video message.<\/p>\n<p>Permission monitors on Samsung and Xiaomi can inadvertently flag and notify you that Telegram requested access to <strong>camera<\/strong> in the background.\nThis happens when the app requests info about the camera — it isn’t using the camera.\nUnfortunately it may look the same to the Samsung and Xiaomi permission monitors.<\/p>\n<p>Camera info is requested by the app when you tap on the attachment button, or start recording a video or a video message.\nIf you do this and quickly close the app, the already initiated request may try to run asynchronously when the app is already in the background, or be sent when the system wakes up the app to show a notification about a new message.\nIn any case, these requests are only for the camera info, the app <em>never<\/em> uses the camera itself in the background.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can check Telegram’s open source code and confirm that the app is not doing anything behind their back.\nWe also offer reproducible builds that can help you prove that the version you downloaded from App Store or Google Play is built from the exact same source code we publish.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Support\n<p>If you have any other questions, please contact Telegram Support (in Telegram go to Settings — Ask a question).\nNote that we rely on volunteers for

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective

Policy<\/li>\n<li>12.\nQuestions and concerns<\/li>\n<\/ul> Telegram Privacy Policy <i>\n<\/i>1.\nIntroduction\n<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Telegram Messenger Inc.\n<strong>(“Telegram”)<\/strong>, use and protect your personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services (the <strong>“Services”<\/strong>).\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Policy, <strong>‘we’<\/strong>, <strong>‘us’<\/strong> and <strong>‘our’<\/strong> refers to Telegram, and <strong>‘you’<\/strong> refers to you, the user of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.1 Privacy Principles\n<p>Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.<\/li>\n<li>We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.2.\nTerms of Service\n<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use our Services and which are available at <strong>https://telegram.org/tos<\/strong>.\nThis Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.3.\nTable of Contents\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the legal basis for processing your personal data;<\/li>\n<li>what personal data we may collect from you;<\/li>\n<li>how we keep your personal data safe;<\/li>\n<li>what we may use your personal data for;<\/li>\n<li>who your personal data may be shared with.\nand <\/li>\n<li>your rights regarding your personal data.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>1.4.\nEEA Representative\n<p>If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are provided by Telegram, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.\nHowever, as Telegram is located outside the EEA, we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies, Telegram UK Holdings Ltd (71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, England, WC2H 9JQ), as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>2.\nLegal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data\n<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests (including: <em>(1)<\/em> providing effective and innovative Services to our users.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.\nWhat Personal Data We Use\n<i>\n<\/i>3.1.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>Telegram is a communication service.\nYou provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.<\/p>\n<p>To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public.\nWe don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n<\/p>\n<p>We do <strong>not<\/strong> require your screen name to be your real name.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name.\nThis way your mother can have the public name 'Johnny Depp' while appearing as 'Mom' to you and as 'Boss' to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.2.\nYour E-mail Address\n<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email.\nThis address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it.\nThat's right: no marketing or “we miss you” bullshit.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.\nYour Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.1.\nCloud Chats\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe store messages, photos, videos and documents from your <em>cloud chats<\/em> on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions.\nThis way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.2.\nSecret Chats\n<p>\n<em>Secret chats<\/em> use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know.\nThere is <strong>no way<\/strong> for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages.\nWe do not store your secret chats on our servers.\nWe also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats.\nFor the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent <em>to<\/em> or <em>from<\/em>.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.3.\nMedia in Secret Chats\n<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server.\nThis key and the file’s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat’s key — and sent to your recipient.\nThey can then download and decipher the file.\nThis means that the file is technically on one of Telegram’s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient.\nWe don’t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to.\nWe periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.4.\nPublic Chats\n<p>In addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups.\nAll public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above).\nLike everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.5.\nPhone Number and Contacts\n<p>Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications.\nWe only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.<\/p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram.\nWhen you open the 'Invite friends' interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<p>You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG).\nIf you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code.\nTelegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>3.3.6.\nCookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.\nWe do not use cookies for profiling or advertising.\nThe cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services, and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience.\nYour browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.\nYou may choose to block cookies with your web browser, however, if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.\nKeeping Your Personal Data Safe\n<i>\n<\/i>4.1.\nStoring Data\n<p>If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands.\nThese are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space.\nHowever, the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram.\nAs such, we do not share your personal data with such data centers.\nAll data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders cannot get access.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.2.\nEnd-to-End Encrypted Data\n<p>Your messages, media and files from secret chats (see section 3.3.2 above), as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient.\nBefore this data reaches our servers, it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient.\nWhile Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data, we have no ways of deciphering the actual information.\nIn this case, we neither store nor process your personal data, rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don’t have.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>4.3.\nRetention\n<p>Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.\nProcessing Your Personal Data\n<i>\n<\/i>5.1.\nOur Services\n<p>Telegram is a cloud service.\nWe will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history, including messages, media and files, to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.2.\nSafety and Security\n<p>Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations.\nTelegram also has more than 400 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers.\nTo improve the security of your account, as well as to prevent spam, abuse, and other violations of our Terms of Service, we may collect metadata such as your IP address, devices and Telegram apps you've used, history of username changes, etc.\nIf collected, this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.3.\nSpam and Abuse\n<p>To prevent phishing, spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram’s Terms of Service, our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients.\nIf a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators, your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently.\nYou can send an appeal using @Spambot.\nIn case of more serious violations, your account may be banned.\nWe may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.4.\nCross-Device Functionality\n<p>We may also store some aggregated metadata to create Telegram features (see section 5.5 below) that work across all your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.5.\nAdvanced features\n<p>We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features.\nFor example, when you open the Search menu, Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen.\nTo do this, we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently.\nA similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with “@”).\nTo turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and disable “Suggest Frequent Contacts”.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>5.6.\nNo Ads\n<p>Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.\nTelegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.\nBot Messages\n<i>\n<\/i>6.1.\nEcosystem\n<p>Telegram has an API that allows third-party developers to create bots.\nBots are apps that look like special Telegram users: you can talk to them from your chat list, add them to groups or use a special “inline” interface to access their features.\nBy performing any of these actions, you will be sending some of your data to the respective third-party bot developers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.2.\nHow Bots Can Receive Data\n<p>You can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>By sending messages to a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By using an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>By participating in a group with a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot.<\/li>\n<li>By paying for goods and services via bots (see section 7 below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.3.\nWhat Data Bots Receive\n<p>In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (see section 3.1 above): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).<\/p>\n<p>Bots can also receive the following data when you <strong>interact<\/strong> with them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.<\/li>\n<li>If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).\n<\/li>\n<li>If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.<\/li>\n<li>When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g.\n@gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot.\nThis query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service.\nWe will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.<\/li>\n<li>Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access.\nIf the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group.\nThe interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>6.4.\nBots Are Not Maintained by Telegram\n<p>Other than our own bots, no other bots or third-party bot developers are affiliated with Telegram.\nThey are completely independent from us.\nThey should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.\nThird Party Payment Services\n<i>\n<\/i>7.1.\nPayment Information\n<p>The Payment Platform for Bots is available to users as of Telegram 4.0.\nTelegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world.\nIt is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details.\nNeither Telegram nor the merchants on the platform (bot developers) have access to this information.\nAlthough we work with payment providers they are completely independent from Telegram.\nPlease study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.2.\nCredit Card Information\n<p>When making a purchase, you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment, and this information goes directly to the payment provider's server.\nYour credit card information never reaches Telegram's servers.\nWe do not access and do not store your credit card information.\nWhen you save your credit card info, it is saved on the respective payment provider's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a <em>token<\/em> that you can reuse for future payments.\nIt is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.3 Shipping Information\n<p>When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order, we send it directly to the merchant bot developer.\nWe can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases.\nWe will delete this information immediately if you ask us to.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.4.\nClearing Payment Information\n<p>You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings and selecting ‘Clear Payment &amp.\nShipping Info’.\nIf you choose to remove your payment information, we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>7.5.\nPayment Disputes\n<p>Due to the fact that Telegram doesn't store any credit card details or transaction information, it is impossible for us to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.\nWho Your Personal Data May Be Shared With\n<i>\n<\/i>8.1.\nOther Telegram Users\n<p>Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information, who may be located outside the EEA.\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram, you are instructing us to transfer your personal data, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures (including encryption of your personal data) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.2.\nTelegram’s Group Companies\n<p>We may share your personal data with: <em>(1)<\/em> our parent company, Telegram Group Inc, located in the British Virgin Islands.\nand <em>(2)<\/em> Telegram FZ-LLC, a group member located in Dubai, to help provide, improve and support our Services.\nWe will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data.\nThis will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies.\nIf you would like more information regarding these clauses, please contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>8.3.\nLaw Enforcement Authorities\n<p>If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you're a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.\nSo far, this has never happened.\nWhen it does, we will include it in a semiannual transparency report published at: https://t.me/transparency.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.\nYour Rights Regarding the Personal Data You Provide to Us\n<i>\n<\/i>9.1.\nYour Rights\n<p>Under applicable data protection legislation, in certain circumstances, you have rights concerning your personal data.\nYou have a right to: <em>(1)<\/em> request a copy of all your personal data that we store and to transmit that copy to another data controller.\n<em>(2)<\/em> delete (see section 10 below) or amend your personal data.\n<em>(3)<\/em> restrict, or object to, the processing of your personal data.\n<em>(4)<\/em> correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold on you.\nand <em>(5)<\/em> lodge a complaint with national data protection authorities regarding our processing of your personal data.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.2.\nExercising Your Rights\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, kindly contact us using the details in section 12 below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>9.3.\nData Settings\n<p>You can control how your data is used (e.g., delete synced contacts) in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nData Settings<\/em> (using one of our mobile apps).\n<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, if you're generally not OK with Telegram's modest requirements, it won't be possible for us to provide you with our Services.\nYou can delete your Telegram account by proceeding to the deactivation page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.\nDeleting data\n<i>\n<\/i>10.1.\nAccounts\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account removes all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nThis action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.2.\nMessages\n<ul>\n<li>In secret chats, deleting a message always instructs the app on the other end to delete it too.<\/li>\n<li>In cloud chats, you can choose to delete a message for all participants within at least 48 hours after sending.\nOtherwise, deleting a message will delete it from your message history.\nThis means that a copy will stay on the server as part of your partner's message history.\nAs soon as your partner deletes it too, it's gone forever.<\/li>\n<li>As of version 5.5, any party can choose to delete any messages in one-on-one chats, both sent and received, for both sides.\nThere is no time limit.\nAny party can also opt to clear the entire chat history for both parties, in which case the apps will be instructed to remove all messages in that chat, however many of them are still retained by either of the participants.<\/li>\n<li>In supergroups and channels, deleting a message removes it for all participants.\nNote that deleted messages and original versions of edited messages from supergroups are stored for 48 hours after deletion in order to be shown in the admins log.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.3.\nSelf-Destructing Messages\n<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to self-destruct.\nAs soon as such a message is read (2 checks appear), the countdown starts.\nWhen the timer expires, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).\nMedia with short timers (less than a minute) are shown with blurred previews.\nThe timer is triggered when they are viewed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>10.4.\nAccount Self-Destruction\n<p>By default, if you stop using Telegram and do not come online for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can go to Settings to change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>11.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n<p>We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAny changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective

What do I do here?\n<p>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free.\nYou can use Telegram on all your devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong> — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.<\/p>\n<p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and <strong>files<\/strong> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to <strong>200,000<\/strong> people or channels for broadcasting to <strong>unlimited<\/strong> audiences.\nYou can write to your phone contacts and find people by their <strong>usernames<\/strong>.\nAs a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs.\nIn addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted voice calls.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who is Telegram for?\n<p>Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and calls.\nBusiness users and small teams may like the large groups, usernames, desktop apps and powerful file sharing options.<\/p>\n<p>Since Telegram groups can have up to 200,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient.\nYou can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace.\nPublic groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.<\/p>\n<p>In case you're more into pictures, Telegram has animated gif search, a state of the art photo editor, and an open sticker platform (find some cool stickers here or here).\nWhat's more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device.\nWith Telegram's cloud support and cache management options, Telegram can take up nearly <strong>zero<\/strong> space on your phone.<\/p>\n<p>Those looking for extra privacy should check out our advanced settings and rather revolutionary policy.\nAnd if you want secrecy, try our device-specific Secret Chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional passcode.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We keep evolving — check out the blog and follow us on twitter and Telegram to stay in touch.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?\n<p>Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync.\nAs a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 2 GB <em>each<\/em>.\nAnd if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Telegram is faster and way more secure.\nOn top of that, Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.<\/p>\n<p>Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own Telegram apps.\nWe also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, integrate any services, and even accept payments from users around the world.\n<\/p>\n<p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\nDon't forget to check out this paragraph for even more exclusive stuff.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How old is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram for iOS was launched on August 14, 2013.\nThe alpha version of Telegram for Android officially launched on October 20, 2013.\nMore and more Telegram clients appear, built by independent developers using Telegram's open platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Which devices can I use?\n<p>You can use Telegram on smartphones, tablets, and even computers.\nWe have apps for iOS (9.0 and above), Android (4.1 and up) and Windows Phone.\nYou can also use Telegram's web version or install one of our desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can log in to Telegram from as many of your devices as you like — all <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use your main mobile phone number to log in everywhere.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Our API is open for developers, should you want to build your own applications for other platforms.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is supported by Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai.\nPavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai's input is technological.\nTo make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers.\nAs a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where is Telegram based?\n<p>The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St.\nPetersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of highly skilled engineers.\nThe Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore.\nWe’re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Will you have ads? Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?\n<p>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.<\/p>\n<p>Pavel Durov, who shares our vision, supplied Telegram with a generous donation, so we have quite enough money for the time being.\nIf Telegram runs out, we will introduce non-essential paid options to support the infrastructure and finance developer salaries.\nBut making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?\n<p>Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years.\nTheir marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts from the people around you.\nAdding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities.\nTelegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, without the usual caveats.\nThis means that instead of diverting public attention with low-impact settings, we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What about GDPR?\n<p>New regulations regarding data privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018.\nSince taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn't much we had to change.\nWe don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we're not part of any mafia family “family of companies.”<\/p>\n<p>Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service — for example, your cloud chats so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more information.<\/p>\n<p>You can use <strong>@GDPRbot<\/strong> to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request a copy of all your data that Telegram stores.<\/li>\n<li>Contact us about Data Privacy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Android users got a GDPR update with version 4.8.9 which allows more control over synced contacts and adds other privacy settings.\nOn June, 1, Apple approved Telegram v.4.8.2 for iOS with these features.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: There's illegal content on Telegram.\nHow do I take it down?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.<\/p>\n<p>But <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.\nIf you find sticker sets or bots on Telegram that you think are illegal, please ping us at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the 'report' buttons right inside our apps, see this post on our official @ISISwatch channel for details.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: If a scammer is pretending to be you, contact @NoToScam<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright.\nWhat do I do?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.\nBut <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org.\nPlease note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?\n<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet.\nTo do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal <strong>public<\/strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app.\nFor example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.<\/p>\n<p>User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI.\nWhenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that this does <strong>not<\/strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.\nFor example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship.\nThis goes against our founders' principles.\nWhile we do block terrorist (e.g.\nISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do I do?\n<p>If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you process data requests?\n<p>Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose.<\/p>\n<p>To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure.\nCloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions.\nThe relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect.\nAs a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression.\nTelegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.<\/p>\n<p>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Basics\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can I write to?\n<p>You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram.\nAnother way of contacting people is to type their Telegram username into the search field.<\/p>\n<p>You can set a public username for your Telegram account too.\nOther people will be able to search and find you by that username — and send messages to you even if they don't know your number.\nYou can learn more about usernames here.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I know who in my contacts has Telegram?\n<p>Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts.\nThey also have pictures.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I invite my friends?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> The basic invitations are simple SMS messages.\nThey will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage).\nNaturally, you have other options to bring your friends here.\nTry sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it.\nThe link: <strong>\n<\/strong>\n<strong>https://telegram.org/dl/<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Windows Phone:<\/em> Go to Contacts &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can give your friends a t.me link with your username so that they can easily find you on Telegram even if they don't have your phone number.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do the check marks mean?\n<p>\n<em>One check<\/em> — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.<br>\n<em>Two checks<\/em> — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).<\/p>\n<p>We don't have a 'delivered to device' status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want.\nSo which particular one would that check mean?<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I hide my ‘last seen’ time?\n<p>You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own.\nYou will, however, see an approximate last seen value.\nThis keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram.\nThere are four possible approximate values:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen recently<\/strong> — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a week<\/strong> — between 2-3 and seven days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a month<\/strong> — between 6-7 days and a month<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen a long time ago<\/strong> — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see me 'online'?\n<p>The last seen rules apply to your online status as well.\nPeople can only see you online if you're sharing your last seen status with them.<\/p>\n<p>There are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online.\nRegardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<li>Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.<\/li>\n<li>Broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you're not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don't do anything of the above, they'll never see you online.\nAnother way of achieving this is to block that person.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I delete my messages?\n<p>Yes.\nPreviously, you could unsend your messages within 48 hours after sending them.\nAs of Telegram 5.5, you can always delete any messages you sent or received in <em>any<\/em> one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own messages only).\nYou can also clear the entire chat history on both ends.\nOn Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.<\/p>\n<p>Together with privacy settings for forwarded messages, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to

How do I get one?\n<p>You can set up a <strong>public<\/strong> username on Telegram.\nIt then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username — you will appear in contacts search under 'global results'.\nPlease note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username in Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does t.me work?\n<p>Once you've set up a username, you can give people a t.me/username link.\nOpening that link on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you.\nYou can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.<\/p>\n<p>This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What can I use as my username?\n<p>You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores.\nUsernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g.\nTelegram and TeleGram is the same user).\nThe username must be at least five characters long.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need a username?\n<p>You don't have to get one.\nRemember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number?\n<p>No.\nNeither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your privacy settings).\nThis is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my username?\n<p>Go to Settings and save an empty username.\nThis will remove your username.\npeople will no longer be able to find you via search.\nThis will not affect existing conversations.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do I do if my username is taken?\n<p>Telegram usernames are distributed on a first come — first serve basis.<\/p>\n<p>We understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some of us.\nIf your desired username is already taken, we will be happy to help you acquire it for your account or channel, provided that you have that same username on at least <strong>two<\/strong> of these services: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the fact that one account can register multiple bot and channel usernames, we reserve the right to recall usernames assigned to unused bots and channels, as well as openly squatted usernames.<\/p>\n<p>To request a username, contact @Username_bot.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if someone is pretending to

useful as well.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How secure is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line.\nWe are based on the MTProto protocol (see description and advanced FAQ), built upon time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections.\nWe are continuously working with the community to improve the security of our protocol and clients.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if I’m more paranoid than your regular user?\n<p>We've got you covered.\nTelegram’s special secret chats use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding.\nOn top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: So how do you encrypt data?\n<p>We support two layers of secure encryption.\nServer-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption.\nAll data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files.<\/p>\n<p>Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.\nYou can find more info in the Advanced FAQ.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Do you process data requests?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why should I trust you?\n<p>Telegram is open, anyone can check our source code, protocol and API, see how everything works and make an informed decision.\nTelegram supports verifiable builds, which allow experts to independently verify that our code published on GitHub is the <strong>exact same code<\/strong> that is used to build the apps you download from App Store or Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome security experts to audit our system and appreciate any feedback at security@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, Telegram's primary focus is not to bring a profit, so commercial interests will never interfere with our mission.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need to trust Telegram for this to be secure?\n<p>When it comes to secret chats, you don't — just make sure that the visualized key of your secret chat matches the one in your friend's secret chat settings.\nMore about this below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if my hacker friend says they could decipher Telegram messages?\n<p>Anyone who claims that Telegram messages can be deciphered is welcome to prove that claim in our competition and win $300,000.\nYou can check out the Cracking Contest Description to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>Any comments on Telegram's security are welcome at security@telegram.org.\nAll submissions which result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging from <strong>$100<\/strong> to <strong>$100,000<\/strong> or more, depending on the severity of the issue.\nPlease note that we can not offer bounties for issues that are disclosed to the public before they are fixed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can Telegram protect me against everything?\n<p>Telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication.\nThis means that all data (including media and files) that you send and receive via Telegram cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your internet service provider, owners of Wi-Fi routers you connect to, or other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>But please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she takes your unlocked phone without a passcode.\nOr from your IT-department if they access your computer at work.\nOr from any other people that get physical or root access to your phones or computers running Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>If you have reasons to worry about your personal security, we strongly recommend using only Secret Chats in official or at least verifiable open-source apps for sensitive information, preferably with a self-destruct timer.\nWe also recommend enabling 2-Step Verification and setting up a strong passcode to lock your app, you will find both options in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does 2-Step Verification work?\n<p>Logging in with an SMS code is an industry standard in messaging, but if you're looking for more security or have reasons to doubt your mobile carrier or government, we recommend protecting your cloud chats with an additional password.<\/p>\n<p>You can do this in <strong>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\n2-Step Verification<\/strong>.\nOnce enabled, you will need both an SMS code and a password to log in.\nYou can also set up a recovery email address that will help regain access, should you forget your password.\nIf you do so, please remember that it's important that the recovery email account is also protected with a strong password and 2-Step Verification when possible.<\/p>\n<p>Check this out for tips on creating a strong password that is easy to remember.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous?\n<p>Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — root access.<\/p>\n<p>A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the internal storage.\nOnce an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile.\nNo application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Secret Chats\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are secret chats different?\n<p>Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella.\nAll messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (more on this here).\nOn top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats.\nAnd when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well.<\/p>\n<p>You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient.\nThe message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices.<\/p>\n<p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud.\nThis means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin.\nThey are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I start a secret chat?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Open the profile of the user you want to contact.\nTap on ‘…’, then ‘Start Secret Chat’.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Swipe right to open the menu, then 'New secret chat'.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific.\nIf you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device.\nIf you log out, you will lose all your secret chats.\nYou can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do self-destructing messages work?\n<p>The Self-Destruct Timer is available for <strong>all messages<\/strong> in Secret Chats and for <strong>media<\/strong> in private cloud chats.<\/p>\n<p>To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit.\nThe clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets two check marks).\nAs soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from <strong>both<\/strong> devices.\nWe will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent <strong>after<\/strong> the timer was set.\nIt has no effect on earlier messages.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I be certain that my conversation partner doesn't take a screenshot?\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices).\nWe will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently.\nWe advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust.\nAfter all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with a different device or an old school camera.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What is this 'Encryption Key' thing?\n<p>When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\nAfter the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat.\nYou can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app.<\/p>\n<p>Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not just make all chats 'secret'?\n<p>All Telegram messages are always securely encrypted.\nMessages in Secret Chats use <strong>client-client<\/strong> encryption, while Cloud Chats use <strong>client-server/server-client<\/strong> encryption and are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more here).\nThis enables your cloud messages to be both secure and immediately accessible from any of your devices – even if you lose your device altogether.<\/p>\n<p>The problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected device (e.g.\nwhen you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in the end-to-end encryption paradigm.\nAt the same time, reliable backups are an essential feature for any mass-market messenger.\nTo solve this problem, some applications (like Whatsapp and Viber) allow decryptable backups that put their users' privacy at risk – even if they do not enable backups themselves.\nOther apps ignore the need for backups altogether and fade into oblivion before ever reaching a million users.<\/p>\n<p>We opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats.\nTelegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of Cloud Chats.\nMeanwhile, the separate entity of Secret Chats gives you full control over the data you do not want to be stored.<\/p>\n<p>This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries.\nWe are convinced that the separation of conversations into Cloud and Secret chats represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular messaging application.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Why Telegram isn't End-to-End Encrypted “by Default”<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Your Account\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see my phone number?\n<p>On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number visible.\nBy default, your number is only visible to people who you've added to your address book as contacts.\nYou can further modify this in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\nPhone Number<\/em>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that people will always see your number if they know it already and <strong>saved<\/strong> it in their address book.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: I have a new phone number, what do I do?\n<p>Each phone number is a <strong>separate<\/strong> account on Telegram.\nYou have several options if you are using multiple phone numbers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you will <strong>no longer use the old number<\/strong> (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to Settings and change the number connected to your Telegram account to the new number.\n<strong>Important:<\/strong> make sure you have access to your connected phone number – otherwise you risk losing access to your account.<\/li>\n<li>If you will use the new number for a <strong>limited time<\/strong> (e.g., you're on a trip or vacation), there's no need to do anything.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to keep using <strong>both numbers<\/strong> (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number.\nYou <em>may<\/em> create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated.\nIt is possible to log in to one Telegram app with up to <strong>3<\/strong> different accounts at once.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I log out?\n<p>Most users don't need to log out of Telegram:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Telegram on many devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use the same phone number to log in on all devices.<\/li>\n<li>You can go to <em>Settings &gt.\nData and Storage &gt.\nStorage Usage&gt.\nClear cache<\/em> to <strong>free up space<\/strong> on your device without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram with <strong>multiple phone numbers<\/strong>, you can switch between accounts without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram on a <strong>shared device<\/strong>, you can set up a passcode in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security<\/em> to make sure only you have access to your account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you do want to log out for some reason, here's how you do that:<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nLog out.<br>\n<em>Android<\/em>, <em>Telegram Desktop<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\n… (in the top right corner) &gt.\nLog out.<\/p>\n<p>If

you log out.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that logging out does <strong>not<\/strong> trigger remote deletion of your secret chat messages on your partner's device — to do that, choose 'Clear History' first.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I change my phone number?\n<p>You can change your number in Telegram and keep <strong>everything<\/strong>, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices.<\/p>\n<p>To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then 'Change Number'.\nIf you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account first.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my account?\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account permanently removes all your <strong>messages<\/strong> and <strong>contacts<\/strong>.\nAll groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights.<\/p>\n<p>This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process.<br>Note that you'll receive the <strong>code<\/strong> via <strong>Telegram<\/strong>, not SMS.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What happens if I delete my account?\n<p>As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted.\nThat said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have <em>their<\/em> copy of the messages you sent them.\nSo if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our self-destruct timer instead.<\/p>\n<p>Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible.\nIf you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back.\nPeople, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified.\nThe new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does account self-destruction work?\n<p>Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space greatly.\nIf you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least six months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My phone was stolen, what do I do?\n<p>First of all, sorry about your phone.\nUnfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment.\nWe don't collect additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account.\nThis means we can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number or to Telegram itself on any of your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>I have access to Telegram on another device\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security and turn on Two-Step Verification.\nThis way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account.<\/li>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.\nWhoever has your phone will not be able to log in again, since they don't know your password.<\/li>\n<li>Contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>If you decide to switch to a new phone number, don't forget to go to Settings, tap on your phone number and change your Telegram number to the new one.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>I don't have access to Telegram on any other devices\n<ol>\n<li>First and foremost, you need to contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>Wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Removing sensitive data\n<p>Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn't much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft.\nBut if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to log out the other device, it is best that you wipe it remotely.\nYou can read more about it here: Apple iOS, Android.\nUnfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario.<\/p>\n<p>You can delete your Telegram account if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop).\nNote that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 6 months being the default setting.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Bots\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer, you may find our Bots FAQ more useful.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are bots?\n<p>Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram.\nThey are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a bot?\n<p>Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming.\nIf you're sure you're up to it, our <strong>Introduction for Developers<\/strong> is a good place to start.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer.\nBut we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop?\n<p>If you don't want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as you would block a human user.\nSome Telegram clients have a 'Stop Bot' button right in the bot's profile.<\/p>\n<p>That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its <em>/help<\/em> for clues.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots safe?\n<p>Yes.\nBots are no different from human users that you meet in groups for example.\nThey can see your public name, username, and profile pictures, and they can see messages you send to them, that's it.\nThey can't access your last seen status and <strong>don't<\/strong> see your phone number (unless you decide to give it to them yourself).<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger — don't give them your passwords, Telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely.\nAlso, be careful when opening files sent by bots, same as you would deal with ordinary humans.\nExample: If a bot sent us a file called <em>OpenMe.exe<\/em>, we probably wouldn't open it.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If I add a bot to my group, can it read my messages?\n<p>Bots can work in two modes when you add them to groups.\nBy default, bots only see messages that are meant for them.\nIn this case, you'll see 'has no access to messages' in the group members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Some bots need more information to work, so developers may disable the privacy mode.\nIn this case, the bot will see all messages sent to the group, and you will see 'has access to messages' in the members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about privacy mode for bots »<\/p>\n<p>If your group contains very sensitive information, maybe it's better to avoid adding bots you don't trust 100%.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots made by Telegram?\n<p>No.\nWhile we have some official bots for specific purposes (like @gif or @GDPRbot), we don't usually make bots.\nBots are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API and platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where can I find more bots?\n<p>There is no official store at the moment, so you'll have to ask your friends or search the web for now.\nWe're pretty sure you'll find some bots to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Deeper questions\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not open source everything?\n<p>All code will be released eventually.\nWe started with the most useful parts — a well-documented API that allows developers to build new Telegram apps, and open source clients that can be verified by security specialists.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I run Telegram using my own server?\n<p>Our architecture does not support federation yet.\nTelegram is a unified cloud service, so creating forks where two users might end up on two different Telegram clouds is unacceptable.\nTo enable you to run your own Telegram server while retaining both speed and security is a task in itself.\nAt the moment, we are undecided on whether or not Telegram should go in this direction.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I use the Telegram API?\n<p>Yes.\nDevelopers for all platforms are welcome to use our protocol, API and even source code.\nCheck out the Getting started section of the docs.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't forget about our Bot API that lets you build cool stuff on our platform.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you have a Privacy Policy?\n<p>Sure.\nCheck this out.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why do you have two apps in the Mac App Store?\n<p>One is our app for macOS, the other is Telegram Lite, the macOS version of our multi-platform client.\nBoth apps are official.\nBoth started out as unofficial applications by two different developers and vary in design and functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram for macOS supports many platform-specific features, such as the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, gesture navigation, integration with the Mac's Share menu and more.\nIt has every feature from the iOS version of the app including Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram Lite is a lightning-fast app, optimized for work-related tasks and handling large communities.\nIt offers a three-column interface, perfect for multitasking and quick access to media, files and links shared in your chats.\nThis app can also be used to export your Telegram data and chats.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I translate Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is officially available in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Korean, Malay, Russian and Ukrainian on most platforms, and we are gradually expanding the list of languages built into the apps.<\/p>\n<p>If you don’t like how a specific element in Telegram's interface is translated in your language, or would like to help us maintain the translation, check out our localization platform.\nEveryone can suggest translations and vote for the best ones, making Telegram localization a community-driven effort.<\/p>\n<p>If you're looking to go beyond suggestions for individual phrases and would like to help us maintain the official translation to your language on a continuous basis, you can contact @TelegramAuditions.\nPlease include a hashtag with the English name of your language (e.g.\n#Albanian) and a few links to phrases on this platform with your <strong>translation suggestions<\/strong> or <strong>comments<\/strong>.\nBe sure read the <strong>Style Guide<\/strong> carefully before you apply.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I help?\n<p>Yes, we are always looking for volunteers to help us with user support.\nIf you would be interested in answering questions about Telegram to users from your country, contact our auditions account.<\/p>\n<p>Before you apply, please check out the Telegram Support Initiative.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Passport\n<p>\n<strong>Telegram Passport<\/strong> is a unified authorization method for services that require personal identification.\nWith Telegram Passport, you can upload your documents once, then instantly share your data with services that require real-world ID (finance, ICOs, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>Your identity documents and personal data will be stored in the Telegram cloud using <strong>End-to-End Encryption<\/strong>.\nTo Telegram, this data is just random gibberish, and we have no access to the information you store in your Telegram Passport.\nWhen you share data, it goes directly to the recipient.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can find more information about Telegram Passport on our blog.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer or owner of a service that requires real-life ID, kindly take a look at <strong>this manual<\/strong>.\nYou can also try requesting Telegram Passport data using this page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Troubleshooting\n<i>\n<\/i>Login and SMS\n<p>Please make sure you are entering your mobile phone number in the international format.<br>I.e.: <code>+(country code)(city or carrier code)(your number)<\/code>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are having registration or login problems, please contact us using this form.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Getting a code via a phone call\n<p>For security reasons, login codes dictated via a phone call are only available for accounts that have <strong>two-step verification<\/strong> enabled (Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nTwo-Step Verification).\n<\/p>\n<p>Please also note that Telegram accounts can only be connected to a mobile number.\nWe currently don't support landline numbers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Getting a code via Telegram\n<p>If you have recently used one of our apps on <strong>another device<\/strong> (it could also be a different app on the same device), we may send the login code <strong>via Telegram<\/strong> instead of SMS.<\/p>\n<p>To receive such a code, just check Telegram from any of your connected devices.\nYou will find it in the chat with Telegram, a verified profile with a blue check:<\/p>\n<p>Login code sent via Telegram<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>WARNING!<\/strong> Please note that getting codes via Telegram should not be considered an alternative to using an <strong>up-to-date phone number<\/strong>.\nIn case of a change in numbers, always make sure Telegram is connected to a phone number <strong>you control<\/strong>, otherwise you risk losing access to your account forever.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Notification problems\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the tips below don't help, check out this detailed guide on <strong>Troubleshooting Notification Issues<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>ANDROID<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings — Notifications and Sounds, make sure that notifications are <strong>ON<\/strong> and Importance is set to <strong>“High”<\/strong> or greater.<\/li>\n<li>Check whether contact or group is <em>muted<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure Google Play Services are installed on your phone.<\/li>\n<li>Check <strong>notification priority<\/strong> for Telegram in <strong>Android settings<\/strong>, it can be called <em>Importance<\/em> or <em>Behaviour<\/em> depending on your device.<\/li>\n<li>If your phone uses some <strong>battery saving software<\/strong>, make sure that Telegram is whitelisted in that application.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: <strong>Huawei<\/strong> and <strong>Xiaomi<\/strong> devices have evil task killer services that interfere with the Telegram notification service.\nFor our notifications to work, you need to add Telegram to allowed apps in those devices' security settings.\nHuawei: Phone Manager App &gt.\nProtected Apps &gt.\nAdd Telegram to the list.\nXiaomi: Services &gt.\nSecurity &gt.\nPermissions &gt.\nAutostart, find Telegram and enable autostart.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>iOS<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings — Notifications and Sounds, make sure that notifications are ON in Telegram.<\/li>\n<li>Check that notifications are <strong>ON<\/strong> in phone Settings.<\/li>\n<li>Check, whether contact or group is <em>muted<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Shut down Telegram (go to home screen, double tap home button, kill Telegram (swipe upwards), then go to phone settings, set the alert style for Telegram to NONE.\nRelaunch Telegram, go to phone settings, set alert style back to banners.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Problems with contacts\n<p>If you know your friends have Telegram, but you can't see them — or they appear as numbers instead of names.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you are using the latest version of the app.<\/li>\n<li>Relaunch the app (by terminating it from processes list and launching again).<\/li>\n<li>Temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again).<\/li>\n<li>If that didn't help, re-login.\nRemember that logging out kills your Secret Chats.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Force quit the app (double tap home button, then swipe up on Telegram), then relaunch and check if it helped.<\/li>\n<li>If that doesn't help, temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again).<\/li>\n<li>If that doesn’t work, re-login: Settings &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nLog Out.\nRemember that logging out kills all your Secret Chats.\nThen log in again.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Deleting contacts on Android\n<p>To delete a contact, open a chat with the person, tap on their profile photo in the top area of the chat screen, then tap on '…' in the top right corner &gt.\n'Delete'.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete the contact completely, make sure you also delete them from your phone contacts.\nTelegram stays in sync and will add the contact back if you don't.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Where did my Secret Chat messages go?\n<p>Secret Chats are established between the two devices they were created on.\nThis means that all those messages are not available in the cloud and cannot be accessed on other devices.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Secret Chats are also tied to your current login session on the device.\nIf you log out and in again, you will lose all your Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Can't send messages to non-contacts\n<p>When users report unwanted messages from a Telegram account, we apply a limit: Reported accounts can only send messages to people who have their number saved as a contact.<\/p>\n<p>This means that if you randomly contact people you don't know and send them annoying messages, you may lose the ability to do so in the future.<\/p>\n<p>If you think that this limit was applied to your account wrongly, please visit this page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram uses the camera or microphone in the background!\n<p>Telegram can use the <strong>microphone<\/strong> in the background if you minimize the app when making a call, recording a video, or recording a voice/video message.<\/p>\n<p>Permission monitors on Samsung and Xiaomi can inadvertently flag and notify you that Telegram requested access to <strong>camera<\/strong> in the background.\nThis happens when the app requests info about the camera — it isn’t using the camera.\nUnfortunately it may look the same to the Samsung and Xiaomi permission monitors.<\/p>\n<p>Camera info is requested by the app when you tap on the attachment button, or start recording a video or a video message.\nIf you do this and quickly close the app, the already initiated request may try to run asynchronously when the app is already in the background, or be sent when the system wakes up the app to show a notification about a new message.\nIn any case, these requests are only for the camera info, the app <em>never<\/em> uses the camera itself in the background.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can check Telegram’s open source code and confirm that the app is not doing anything behind their back.\nWe also offer reproducible builds that can help you prove that the version you downloaded from App Store or Google Play is built from the exact same source code we publish.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Support\n<p>If you have any other questions, please contact Telegram Support (in Telegram go to Settings — Ask a question).\nNote that we rely on volunteers for support.<\/p>\n<p>If you can't log in to your account, please use this form.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Twitter?\n<p>Yep.\nFollow us! <strong>@telegram<\/strong>\n<br>Our twitter account in Spanish:

What do I do here?\n<p>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free.\nYou can use Telegram on all your devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong> — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.<\/p>\n<p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and <strong>files<\/strong> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to <strong>200,000<\/strong> people or channels for broadcasting to <strong>unlimited<\/strong> audiences.\nYou can write to your phone contacts and find people by their <strong>usernames<\/strong>.\nAs a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs.\nIn addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted voice calls.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who is Telegram for?\n<p>Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and calls.\nBusiness users and small teams may like the large groups, usernames, desktop apps and powerful file sharing options.<\/p>\n<p>Since Telegram groups can have up to 200,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient.\nYou can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace.\nPublic groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.<\/p>\n<p>In case you're more into pictures, Telegram has animated gif search, a state of the art photo editor, and an open sticker platform (find some cool stickers here or here).\nWhat's more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device.\nWith Telegram's cloud support and cache management options, Telegram can take up nearly <strong>zero<\/strong> space on your phone.<\/p>\n<p>Those looking for extra privacy should check out our advanced settings and rather revolutionary policy.\nAnd if you want secrecy, try our device-specific Secret Chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional passcode.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We keep evolving — check out the blog and follow us on twitter and Telegram to stay in touch.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?\n<p>Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync.\nAs a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 2 GB <em>each<\/em>.\nAnd if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Telegram is faster and way more secure.\nOn top of that, Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.<\/p>\n<p>Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own Telegram apps.\nWe also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, integrate any services, and even accept payments from users around the world.\n<\/p>\n<p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\nDon't forget to check out this paragraph for even more exclusive stuff.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How old is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram for iOS was launched on August 14, 2013.\nThe alpha version of Telegram for Android officially launched on October 20, 2013.\nMore and more Telegram clients appear, built by independent developers using Telegram's open platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Which devices can I use?\n<p>You can use Telegram on smartphones, tablets, and even computers.\nWe have apps for iOS (9.0 and above), Android (4.1 and up) and Windows Phone.\nYou can also use Telegram's web version or install one of our desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can log in to Telegram from as many of your devices as you like — all <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use your main mobile phone number to log in everywhere.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Our API is open for developers, should you want to build your own applications for other platforms.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is supported by Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai.\nPavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai's input is technological.\nTo make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers.\nAs a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where is Telegram based?\n<p>The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St.\nPetersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of highly skilled engineers.\nThe Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore.\nWe’re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Will you have ads? Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?\n<p>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.<\/p>\n<p>Pavel Durov, who shares our vision, supplied Telegram with a generous donation, so we have quite enough money for the time being.\nIf Telegram runs out, we will introduce non-essential paid options to support the infrastructure and finance developer salaries.\nBut making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?\n<p>Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years.\nTheir marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts from the people around you.\nAdding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities.\nTelegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, without the usual caveats.\nThis means that instead of diverting public attention with low-impact settings, we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What about GDPR?\n<p>New regulations regarding data privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018.\nSince taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn't much we had to change.\nWe don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we're not part of any mafia family “family of companies.”<\/p>\n<p>Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service — for example, your cloud chats so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more information.<\/p>\n<p>You can use <strong>@GDPRbot<\/strong> to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request a copy of all your data that Telegram stores.<\/li>\n<li>Contact us about Data Privacy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Android users got a GDPR update with version 4.8.9 which allows more control over synced contacts and adds other privacy settings.\nOn June, 1, Apple approved Telegram v.4.8.2 for iOS with these features.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: There's illegal content on Telegram.\nHow do I take it down?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.<\/p>\n<p>But <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.\nIf you find sticker sets or bots on Telegram that you think are illegal, please ping us at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the 'report' buttons right inside our apps, see this post on our official @ISISwatch channel for details.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: If a scammer is pretending to be you, contact @NoToScam<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright.\nWhat do I do?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.\nBut <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org.\nPlease note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?\n<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet.\nTo do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal <strong>public<\/strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app.\nFor example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.<\/p>\n<p>User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI.\nWhenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that this does <strong>not<\/strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.\nFor example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship.\nThis goes against our founders' principles.\nWhile we do block terrorist (e.g.\nISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do I do?\n<p>If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you process data requests?\n<p>Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose.<\/p>\n<p>To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure.\nCloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions.\nThe relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect.\nAs a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression.\nTelegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.<\/p>\n<p>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Basics\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can I write to?\n<p>You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram.\nAnother way of contacting people is to type their Telegram username into the search field.<\/p>\n<p>You can set a public username for your Telegram account too.\nOther people will be able to search and find you by that username — and send messages to you even if they don't know your number.\nYou can learn more about usernames here.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I know who in my contacts has Telegram?\n<p>Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts.\nThey also have pictures.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I invite my friends?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> The basic invitations are simple SMS messages.\nThey will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage).\nNaturally, you have other options to bring your friends here.\nTry sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it.\nThe link: <strong>\n<\/strong>\n<strong>https://telegram.org/dl/<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Windows Phone:<\/em> Go to Contacts &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can give your friends a t.me link with your username so that they can easily find you on Telegram even if they don't have your phone number.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do the check marks mean?\n<p>\n<em>One check<\/em> — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.<br>\n<em>Two checks<\/em> — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).<\/p>\n<p>We don't have a 'delivered to device' status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want.\nSo which particular one would that check mean?<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I hide my ‘last seen’ time?\n<p>You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own.\nYou will, however, see an approximate last seen value.\nThis keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram.\nThere are four possible approximate values:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen recently<\/strong> — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a week<\/strong> — between 2-3 and seven days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a month<\/strong> — between 6-7 days and a month<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen a long time ago<\/strong> — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see me 'online'?\n<p>The last seen rules apply to your online status as well.\nPeople can only see you online if you're sharing your last seen status with them.<\/p>\n<p>There are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online.\nRegardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<li>Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.<\/li>\n<li>Broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you're not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don't do anything of the above, they'll never see you online.\nAnother way of achieving this is to block that person.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I delete my messages?\n<p>Yes.\nPreviously, you could unsend your messages within 48 hours after sending them.\nAs of Telegram 5.5, you can always delete any messages you sent or received in <em>any<\/em> one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own messages only).\nYou can also clear the entire chat history on both ends.\nOn Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.<\/p>\n<p>Together with privacy settings for forwarded messages, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder).\nAs a result, our users no longer need to worry about the data accumulating in their chats over the years.\nBoth parties in a conversation now have full control over what does and what doesn't belong to their online identity.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I make calls via Telegram?\n<p>Yes! Voice calls are currently available to users around the world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How can I use emoticons in Telegram on my iOS device?\n<p>We support emoji emoticons.\nSimply enable the Emoji keyboard in your iOS device's Settings (General &gt.\nKeyboards &gt.\nAdd New Keyboard… &gt.\nEmoji).\nThen switch to that keyboard whenever you're out of words.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Groups and Channels\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What makes Telegram groups cool?\n<p>Telegram groups can have up to <strong>200,000 members<\/strong> each and are extremely powerful communication tools.\nHere are a few key features that make them stand out in the messaging world: <\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unified history<\/strong>\n<br>Edit your messages after posting, delete them so that they disappear for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cross-platform availability<\/strong>\n<br>Access your messages anytime, from any number of your mobile or desktop devices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Instant search<\/strong>\n<br>Find the message you're looking for, even among millions.\nFilter by sender to make searching easier.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Replies, mentions, hashtags<\/strong>\n<br>Easily trace a conversation and keep communication efficient, no matter the group size.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Smart notifications<\/strong>\n<br>Mute the group to get notifications only when people mention you or reply to your messages.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pinned messages<\/strong>\n<br>You can pin any message to be displayed at the top of the chat screen.\nAll members will get a notification — even if they muted ordinary messages from your group.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Moderation tools<\/strong>\n<br>Appoint administrators that can mass-delete messages, control membership, and pin important messages.\nDefine their admin privileges with granular precision.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Group permissions<\/strong>\n<br>Set default permissions to restrict all members from posting specific kinds of content.\nOr even restrict members from sending messages altogether – and let the admins chat amongst themselves while everybody else is watching.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>File sharing<\/strong>\n<br>Send and receive files of any type, up to 2 GB in size each, access them instantly on your other devices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Public groups<\/strong>\n<br>Get a short link for your group and make it public, like t.me/publictestgroup.\nThis way, anybody can view the group's entire chat history and join to post messages.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customization via bots<\/strong>\n<br>Create custom tools for any specific needs using our Bot API and Inline Bots.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What's the difference between groups and channels?\n<p>Telegram <strong>groups<\/strong> are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams.\nBut groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members.\nYou can make any group <strong>public<\/strong>, toggle <strong>persistent history<\/strong> to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint <strong>administrators<\/strong> with granular privileges.\nYou can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Channels<\/strong> are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences.\nIn fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers.\nWhen you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your own.\nEach message in a channel has a <strong>view counter<\/strong> that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about channels in the Channels FAQ »<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a group?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Start a new message (tap the icon in the top right corner in Chats) &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Tap the circular pencil icon in the chat list &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:<\/em> Click the menu button in the top left corner &gt.\n'New Group'.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I assign administrators?\n<p>You can add administrators to help you manage your group and define their privileges with granular precision.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Go to Group Info (tap the photo in the top right corner on the group‘s chat screen) &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Go to Group Info (tap the name in the header) &gt.\nthe pencil icon (in the top right corner) &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:<\/em> When in the group, click '…' in the top right corner &gt.\nManage group &gt.\nAdministrators.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I add more members? What's an invite link?\n<p>You can add your contacts, or using search by username.<\/p>\n<p>It is easy to migrate existing groups to Telegram by sending people an <strong>invite link<\/strong>.\nTo create an invite link, go to Group Info &gt.\nAdd Member &gt.\nInvite to Group via Link.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who has Telegram installed will be able to join your group by following this link.\nIf you choose to revoke the link, it will stop working immediately.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about invite links in our blog »<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Usernames and t.me\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are usernames? How do I get one?\n<p>You can set up a <strong>public<\/strong> username on Telegram.\nIt then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username — you will appear in contacts search under 'global results'.\nPlease note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username in Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does t.me work?\n<p>Once you've set up a username, you can give people a t.me/username link.\nOpening that link on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you.\nYou can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.<\/p>\n<p>This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What can I use as my username?\n<p>You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores.\nUsernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g.\nTelegram and TeleGram is the same user).\nThe username must be at least five characters long.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need a username?\n<p>You don't have to get one.\nRemember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number?\n<p>No.\nNeither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your privacy settings).\nThis is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my username?\n<p>Go to Settings and save an empty username.\nThis will remove your username.\npeople will no longer be able to find you via search.\nThis will not affect existing conversations.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do I do if my username is taken?\n<p>Telegram usernames are distributed on a first come — first serve basis.<\/p>\n<p>We understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some of us.\nIf your desired username is already taken, we will be happy to help you acquire it for your account or channel, provided that you have that same username on at least <strong>two<\/strong> of these services: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the fact that one account can register multiple bot and channel usernames, we reserve the right to recall usernames assigned to unused bots and channels, as well as openly squatted usernames.<\/p>\n<p>To request a username, contact @Username_bot.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if someone is pretending to

useful as well.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How secure is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line.\nWe are based on the MTProto protocol (see description and advanced FAQ), built upon time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections.\nWe are continuously working with the community to improve the security of our protocol and clients.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if I’m more paranoid than your regular user?\n<p>We've got you covered.\nTelegram’s special secret chats use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding.\nOn top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: So how do you encrypt data?\n<p>We support two layers of secure encryption.\nServer-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption.\nAll data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files.<\/p>\n<p>Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.\nYou can find more info in the Advanced FAQ.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Do you process data requests?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why should I trust you?\n<p>Telegram is open, anyone can check our source code, protocol and API, see how everything works and make an informed decision.\nTelegram supports verifiable builds, which allow experts to independently verify that our code published on GitHub is the <strong>exact same code<\/strong> that is used to build the apps you download from App Store or Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome security experts to audit our system and appreciate any feedback at security@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, Telegram's primary focus is not to bring a profit, so commercial interests will never interfere with our mission.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need to trust Telegram for this to be secure?\n<p>When it comes to secret chats, you don't — just make sure that the visualized key of your secret chat matches the one in your friend's secret chat settings.\nMore about this below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if my hacker friend says they could decipher Telegram messages?\n<p>Anyone who claims that Telegram messages can be deciphered is welcome to prove that claim in our competition and win $300,000.\nYou can check out the Cracking Contest Description to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>Any comments on Telegram's security are welcome at security@telegram.org.\nAll submissions which result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging from <strong>$100<\/strong> to <strong>$100,000<\/strong> or more, depending on the severity of the issue.\nPlease note that we can not offer bounties for issues that are disclosed to the public before they are fixed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can Telegram protect me against everything?\n<p>Telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication.\nThis means that all data (including media and files) that you send and receive via Telegram cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your internet service provider, owners of Wi-Fi routers you connect to, or other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>But please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she takes your unlocked phone without a passcode.\nOr from your IT-department if they access your computer at work.\nOr from any other people that get physical or root access to your phones or computers running Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>If you have reasons to worry about your personal security, we strongly recommend using only Secret Chats in official or at least verifiable open-source apps for sensitive information, preferably with a self-destruct timer.\nWe also recommend enabling 2-Step Verification and setting up a strong passcode to lock your app, you will find both options in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does 2-Step Verification work?\n<p>Logging in with an SMS code is an industry standard in messaging, but if you're looking for more security or have reasons to doubt your mobile carrier or government, we recommend protecting your cloud chats with an additional password.<\/p>\n<p>You can do this in <strong>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\n2-Step Verification<\/strong>.\nOnce enabled, you will need both an SMS code and a password to log in.\nYou can also set up a recovery email address that will help regain access, should you forget your password.\nIf you do so, please remember that it's important that the recovery email account is also protected with a strong password and 2-Step Verification when possible.<\/p>\n<p>Check this out for tips on creating a strong password that is easy to remember.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous?\n<p>Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — root access.<\/p>\n<p>A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the internal storage.\nOnce an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile.\nNo application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Secret Chats\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are secret chats different?\n<p>Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella.\nAll messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (more on this here).\nOn top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats.\nAnd when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well.<\/p>\n<p>You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient.\nThe message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices.<\/p>\n<p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud.\nThis means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin.\nThey are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I start a secret chat?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Open the profile of the user you want to contact.\nTap on ‘…’, then ‘Start Secret Chat’.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Swipe right to open the menu, then 'New secret chat'.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific.\nIf you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device.\nIf you log out, you will lose all your secret chats.\nYou can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do self-destructing messages work?\n<p>The Self-Destruct Timer is available for <strong>all messages<\/strong> in Secret Chats and for <strong>media<\/strong> in private cloud chats.<\/p>\n<p>To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit.\nThe clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets two check marks).\nAs soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from <strong>both<\/strong> devices.\nWe will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent <strong>after<\/strong> the timer was set.\nIt has no effect on earlier messages.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I be certain that my conversation partner doesn't take a screenshot?\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices).\nWe will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently.\nWe advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust.\nAfter all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with a different device or an old school camera.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What is this 'Encryption Key' thing?\n<p>When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\nAfter the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat.\nYou can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app.<\/p>\n<p>Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not just make all chats 'secret'?\n<p>All Telegram messages are always securely encrypted.\nMessages in Secret Chats use <strong>client-client<\/strong> encryption, while Cloud Chats use <strong>client-server/server-client<\/strong> encryption and are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more here).\nThis enables your cloud messages to be both secure and immediately accessible from any of your devices – even if you lose your device altogether.<\/p>\n<p>The problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected device (e.g.\nwhen you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in the end-to-end encryption paradigm.\nAt the same time, reliable backups are an essential feature for any mass-market messenger.\nTo solve this problem, some applications (like Whatsapp and Viber) allow decryptable backups that put their users' privacy at risk – even if they do not enable backups themselves.\nOther apps ignore the need for backups altogether and fade into oblivion before ever reaching a million users.<\/p>\n<p>We opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats.\nTelegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of Cloud Chats.\nMeanwhile, the separate entity of Secret Chats gives you full control over the data you do not want to be stored.<\/p>\n<p>This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries.\nWe are convinced that the separation of conversations into Cloud and Secret chats represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular messaging application.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Why Telegram isn't End-to-End Encrypted “by Default”<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Your Account\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see my phone number?\n<p>On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number

have a new phone number, what do I do?\n<p>Each phone number is a <strong>separate<\/strong> account on Telegram.\nYou have several options if you are using multiple phone numbers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you will <strong>no longer use the old number<\/strong> (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to Settings and change the number connected to your Telegram account to the new number.\n<strong>Important:<\/strong> make sure you have access to your connected phone number – otherwise you risk losing access to your account.<\/li>\n<li>If you will use the new number for a <strong>limited time<\/strong> (e.g., you're on a trip or vacation), there's no need to do anything.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to keep using <strong>both numbers<\/strong> (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number.\nYou <em>may<\/em> create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated.\nIt is possible to log in to one Telegram app with up to <strong>3<\/strong> different accounts at once.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I log out?\n<p>Most users don't need to log out of Telegram:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Telegram on many devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use the same phone number to log in on all devices.<\/li>\n<li>You can go to

<strong>multiple phone numbers<\/strong>, you can switch between accounts without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram on a <strong>shared device<\/strong>, you can set up a passcode in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security<\/em> to make sure only you have access to your account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you do want to log out for some reason, here's how you do

you log out.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that logging out does <strong>not<\/strong> trigger remote deletion of your secret chat messages on your partner's device — to do that, choose 'Clear History' first.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I change my phone number?\n<p>You can change your number in Telegram and keep <strong>everything<\/strong>, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices.<\/p>\n<p>To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then 'Change Number'.\nIf you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account first.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my account?\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account permanently removes all your <strong>messages<\/strong> and <strong>contacts<\/strong>.\nAll groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights.<\/p>\n<p>This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process.<br>Note that you'll receive the <strong>code<\/strong> via <strong>Telegram<\/strong>, not

associated with your account will be deleted.\nThat said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have <em>their<\/em> copy of the messages

again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back.\nPeople, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified.\nThe new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does account self-destruction work?\n<p>Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space greatly.\nIf you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least six months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My phone was stolen, what do I do?\n<p>First of all, sorry about your phone.\nUnfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment.\nWe don't collect additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account.\nThis means we can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number or to Telegram itself on any of your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>I have access to Telegram on another device\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security and turn on Two-Step Verification.\nThis way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account.<\/li>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.\nWhoever has your phone will not be able to log in again, since they don't know your password.<\/li>\n<li>Contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>If you decide to switch to a new phone number, don't forget to go to Settings, tap on your phone number and change your Telegram number to the new one.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>I don't have access to Telegram on any other devices\n<ol>\n<li>First and foremost, you need to contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>Wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Removing sensitive data\n<p>Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn't much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft.\nBut if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to log out the other device, it is best that you wipe it remotely.\nYou can read more about it here: Apple iOS, Android.\nUnfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario.<\/p>\n<p>You can delete your Telegram account if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop).\nNote that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 6 months being the default setting.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Bots\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer, you may find our Bots FAQ more useful.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are bots?\n<p>Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram.\nThey are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a bot?\n<p>Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming.\nIf you're sure you're up to it, our <strong>Introduction for Developers<\/strong> is a good place to start.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer.\nBut we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop?\n<p>If you don't want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as you would block a human user.\nSome Telegram clients have a 'Stop Bot' button right in the bot's profile.<\/p>\n<p>That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its <em>/help<\/em> for clues.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots safe?\n<p>Yes.\nBots are no different from human users that you meet in groups for example.\nThey can see your public name, username, and profile pictures, and they can see messages you send to them, that's it.\nThey can't access your last seen status and <strong>don't<\/strong> see your phone number (unless you decide to give it to them yourself).<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger — don't give them your passwords, Telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely.\nAlso, be careful when opening files sent by bots, same as you would deal with ordinary humans.\nExample: If a bot sent us a file called <em>OpenMe.exe<\/em>, we probably wouldn't open it.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If I add a bot to my group, can it read my messages?\n<p>Bots can work in two modes when you add them to groups.\nBy default, bots only see messages that are meant for them.\nIn this case, you'll see 'has no access to messages' in the group members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Some bots need more information to work, so developers may disable the privacy mode.\nIn this case, the bot will see all messages sent to the group, and you will see 'has access to messages' in the members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about privacy mode for bots »<\/p>\n<p>If your group contains very sensitive information, maybe it's better to avoid adding bots you don't trust 100%.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots made by Telegram?\n<p>No.\nWhile we have some official bots for specific purposes (like @gif or @GDPRbot), we don't usually make bots.\nBots are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API and platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where can I find more bots?\n<p>There is no official store at the moment, so you'll have to ask your friends or search the web for now.\nWe're pretty sure you'll find some bots to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Deeper questions\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not open source everything?\n<p>All code will be released eventually.\nWe started with the most useful parts — a well-documented API that allows developers to build new Telegram apps, and open source clients that can be verified by security specialists.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I run Telegram using my own server?\n<p>Our architecture does not support federation yet.\nTelegram is a unified cloud service, so creating forks where two users might end up on two different Telegram clouds is unacceptable.\nTo enable you to run your own Telegram server while retaining both speed and security is a task in itself.\nAt the moment, we are undecided on whether or not Telegram should go in this direction.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I use the Telegram API?\n<p>Yes.\nDevelopers for all platforms are welcome to use our protocol, API and even source code.\nCheck out the Getting started section of the docs.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't forget about our Bot API that lets you build cool stuff on our platform.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you have a Privacy Policy?\n<p>Sure.\nCheck this out.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why do you have two apps in the Mac App Store?\n<p>One is our app for macOS, the other is Telegram Lite, the macOS version of our multi-platform client.\nBoth apps are official.\nBoth started out as unofficial applications by two different developers and vary in design and functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram for macOS supports many platform-specific features, such as the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, gesture navigation, integration with the Mac's Share menu and more.\nIt has every feature from the iOS version of the app including Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram Lite is a lightning-fast app, optimized for work-related tasks and handling large communities.\nIt offers a three-column interface, perfect for multitasking and quick access to media, files and links shared in your chats.\nThis app can also be used to export your Telegram data and chats.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I translate Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is officially available in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Korean, Malay, Russian and Ukrainian on most platforms, and we are gradually expanding the list of languages built into the apps.<\/p>\n<p>If you don’t like how a specific element in Telegram's interface is translated in your language, or would like to help us maintain the translation, check out our localization platform.\nEveryone can suggest translations and vote for the best ones, making Telegram localization a community-driven effort.<\/p>\n<p>If you're looking to go beyond suggestions for individual phrases and would like to help us maintain the official translation to your language on a continuous basis, you can contact @TelegramAuditions.\nPlease include a hashtag with the English name of your language (e.g.\n#Albanian) and a few links to phrases on this platform with your <strong>translation suggestions<\/strong> or <strong>comments<\/strong>.\nBe sure read the <strong>Style Guide<\/strong> carefully before you apply.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I help?\n<p>Yes, we are always looking for volunteers to help us with user support.\nIf you would be interested in answering questions about Telegram to users from your country, contact our auditions account.<\/p>\n<p>Before you apply, please check out the Telegram Support Initiative.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Passport\n<p>\n<strong>Telegram Passport<\/strong> is a unified authorization method for services that require personal identification.\nWith Telegram Passport, you can upload your documents once, then instantly share your data with services that require real-world ID (finance, ICOs, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>Your identity documents and personal data will be stored in the Telegram cloud using <strong>End-to-End Encryption<\/strong>.\nTo Telegram, this data is just random gibberish, and we have no access to the information you store in your Telegram Passport.\nWhen you share data, it goes directly to the recipient.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can find more information about Telegram Passport on our blog.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer or owner of a service that requires real-life ID, kindly take a look at <strong>this manual<\/strong>.\nYou can also try requesting Telegram Passport data using this page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Troubleshooting\n<i>\n<\/i>Login and SMS\n<p>Please make sure you are entering your mobile phone number in the international format.<br>I.e.: <code>+(country code)(city or carrier code)(your number)<\/code>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are having registration or login problems, please contact us using this form.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Getting a code via a phone call\n<p>For security reasons, login codes dictated via a phone call are only available for accounts that have <strong>two-step verification<\/strong> enabled (Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nTwo-Step Verification).\n<\/p>\n<p>Please also note that Telegram accounts can only be connected to a mobile number.\nWe currently don't support landline numbers.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Getting a code via Telegram\n<p>If you have recently used one of our apps on <strong>another device<\/strong> (it could also be a different app on the same device), we may send the login code <strong>via Telegram<\/strong> instead of SMS.<\/p>\n<p>To receive such a code, just check Telegram from any of your connected devices.\nYou will find it in the chat with Telegram, a verified profile with a blue check:<\/p>\n<p>Login code sent via Telegram<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>WARNING!<\/strong> Please note that getting codes via Telegram should not be considered an alternative to using an <strong>up-to-date phone number<\/strong>.\nIn case of a change in numbers, always make sure Telegram is connected to a phone number <strong>you control<\/strong>, otherwise you risk losing access to your account forever.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Notification problems\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the tips below don't help, check out this detailed guide on <strong>Troubleshooting Notification Issues<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>ANDROID<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings — Notifications and Sounds, make sure that notifications are <strong>ON<\/strong> and Importance is set to <strong>“High”<\/strong> or greater.<\/li>\n<li>Check whether contact or group is <em>muted<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure Google Play Services are installed on your phone.<\/li>\n<li>Check <strong>notification priority<\/strong> for Telegram in <strong>Android settings<\/strong>, it can be called <em>Importance<\/em> or <em>Behaviour<\/em> depending on your device.<\/li>\n<li>If your phone uses some <strong>battery saving software<\/strong>, make sure that Telegram is whitelisted in that application.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: <strong>Huawei<\/strong> and <strong>Xiaomi<\/strong> devices have evil task killer services that interfere with the Telegram notification service.\nFor our notifications to work, you need to add Telegram to allowed apps in those devices' security settings.\nHuawei: Phone Manager App &gt.\nProtected Apps &gt.\nAdd Telegram to the list.\nXiaomi: Services &gt.\nSecurity &gt.\nPermissions &gt.\nAutostart, find Telegram and enable autostart.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>iOS<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings — Notifications and Sounds, make sure that notifications are ON in Telegram.<\/li>\n<li>Check that notifications are <strong>ON<\/strong> in phone Settings.<\/li>\n<li>Check, whether contact or group is <em>muted<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Shut down Telegram (go to home screen, double tap home button, kill Telegram (swipe upwards), then go to phone settings, set the alert style for Telegram to NONE.\nRelaunch Telegram, go to phone settings, set alert style back to banners.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Problems with contacts\n<p>If you know your friends have Telegram, but you can't see them — or they appear as numbers instead of names.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure you are using the latest version of the app.<\/li>\n<li>Relaunch the app (by terminating it from processes list and launching again).<\/li>\n<li>Temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again).<\/li>\n<li>If that didn't help, re-login.\nRemember that logging out kills your Secret Chats.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Force quit the app (double tap home button, then swipe up on Telegram), then relaunch and check if it helped.<\/li>\n<li>If that doesn't help, temporarily change the name of the contact in phone contacts (add a few symbols, then change back again).<\/li>\n<li>If that doesn’t work, re-login: Settings &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nLog Out.\nRemember that logging out kills all your Secret Chats.\nThen log in again.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Deleting contacts on Android\n<p>To delete a contact, open a chat with the person, tap on their profile photo in the top area of the chat screen, then tap on '…' in the top right corner &gt.\n'Delete'.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to delete the contact completely, make sure you also delete them from your phone contacts.\nTelegram stays in sync and will add the contact back if you don't.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Where did my Secret Chat messages go?\n<p>Secret Chats are established between the two devices they were created on.\nThis means that all those messages are not available in the cloud and cannot be accessed on other devices.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Secret Chats are also tied to your current login session on the device.\nIf you log out and in again, you will lose all your Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Can't send messages to non-contacts\n<p>When users report unwanted messages from a Telegram account, we apply a limit: Reported accounts can only send messages to people who have their number saved as a contact.<\/p>\n<p>This means that if you randomly contact people you don't know and send them annoying messages, you may lose the ability to do so in the future.<\/p>\n<p>If you think that this limit was applied to your account wrongly, please visit this page.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram uses the camera or microphone in the background!\n<p>Telegram can use the <strong>microphone<\/strong> in the background if you minimize the app when making a call, recording a video, or recording a voice/video message.<\/p>\n<p>Permission monitors on Samsung and Xiaomi can inadvertently flag and notify you that Telegram requested access to <strong>camera<\/strong> in the background.\nThis happens when the app requests info about the camera — it isn’t using the camera.\nUnfortunately it may look the same to the Samsung and Xiaomi permission monitors.<\/p>\n<p>Camera info is requested by the app when you tap on the attachment button, or start recording a video or a video message.\nIf you do this and quickly close the app, the already initiated request may try to run asynchronously when the app is already in the background, or be sent when the system wakes up the app to show a notification about a new message.\nIn any case, these requests are only for the camera info, the app <em>never<\/em> uses the camera itself in the background.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can check Telegram’s open source code and confirm that the app is not doing anything behind their back.\nWe also offer reproducible builds that can help you prove that the version you downloaded from App Store or Google Play is built from the exact same source code we publish.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Support\n<p>If you have any other questions, please contact Telegram Support (in Telegram go to Settings — Ask a question).\nNote that we rely on volunteers for

What do I do here?\n<p>Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free.\nYou can use Telegram on all your devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong> — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.<\/p>\n<p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and <strong>files<\/strong> of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to <strong>200,000<\/strong> people or channels for broadcasting to <strong>unlimited<\/strong> audiences.\nYou can write to your phone contacts and find people by their <strong>usernames<\/strong>.\nAs a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs.\nIn addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted voice calls.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who is Telegram for?\n<p>Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and calls.\nBusiness users and small teams may like the large groups, usernames, desktop apps and powerful file sharing options.<\/p>\n<p>Since Telegram groups can have up to 200,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient.\nYou can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace.\nPublic groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.<\/p>\n<p>In case you're more into pictures, Telegram has animated gif search, a state of the art photo editor, and an open sticker platform (find some cool stickers here or here).\nWhat's more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device.\nWith Telegram's cloud support and cache management options, Telegram can take up nearly <strong>zero<\/strong> space on your phone.<\/p>\n<p>Those looking for extra privacy should check out our advanced settings and rather revolutionary policy.\nAnd if you want secrecy, try our device-specific Secret Chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional passcode.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We keep evolving — check out the blog and follow us on twitter and Telegram to stay in touch.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How is Telegram different from WhatsApp?\n<p>Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync.\nAs a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 2 GB <em>each<\/em>.\nAnd if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, Telegram is faster and way more secure.\nOn top of that, Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.<\/p>\n<p>Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own Telegram apps.\nWe also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, integrate any services, and even accept payments from users around the world.\n<\/p>\n<p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\nDon't forget to check out this paragraph for even more exclusive stuff.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How old is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram for iOS was launched on August 14, 2013.\nThe alpha version of Telegram for Android officially launched on October 20, 2013.\nMore and more Telegram clients appear, built by independent developers using Telegram's open platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Which devices can I use?\n<p>You can use Telegram on smartphones, tablets, and even computers.\nWe have apps for iOS (9.0 and above), Android (4.1 and up) and Windows Phone.\nYou can also use Telegram's web version or install one of our desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can log in to Telegram from as many of your devices as you like — all <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use your main mobile phone number to log in everywhere.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Our API is open for developers, should you want to build your own applications for other platforms.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who are the people behind Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is supported by Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai.\nPavel supports Telegram financially and ideologically while Nikolai's input is technological.\nTo make Telegram possible, Nikolai developed a unique custom data protocol, which is open, secure and optimized for work with multiple data-centers.\nAs a result, Telegram combines security, reliability and speed on any network.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where is Telegram based?\n<p>The Telegram development team is based in Dubai.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the developers behind Telegram originally come from St.\nPetersburg, the city famous for its unprecedented number of highly skilled engineers.\nThe Telegram team had to leave Russia due to local IT regulations and has tried a number of locations as its base, including Berlin, London and Singapore.\nWe’re currently happy with Dubai, although are ready to relocate again if local regulations change.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Will you have ads? Or sell my data? Or steal my beloved and enslave my children?\n<p>No.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are you going to make money out of this?\n<p>We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free.<\/p>\n<p>Pavel Durov, who shares our vision, supplied Telegram with a generous donation, so we have quite enough money for the time being.\nIf Telegram runs out, we will introduce non-essential paid options to support the infrastructure and finance developer salaries.\nBut making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are your thoughts on internet privacy?\n<p>Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years.\nTheir marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts from the people around you.\nAdding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities.\nTelegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, without the usual caveats.\nThis means that instead of diverting public attention with low-impact settings, we can afford to focus on the real privacy issues that exist in the modern world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What about GDPR?\n<p>New regulations regarding data privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in Europe on May 25, 2018.\nSince taking back our right to privacy was the reason we made Telegram, there wasn't much we had to change.\nWe don’t use your data for ad targeting, we don’t sell it to others, and we're not part of any mafia family “family of companies.”<\/p>\n<p>Telegram only keeps the information it needs to function as a feature-rich cloud service — for example, your cloud chats so that you can access them from any devices without using third-party backups, or your contacts so that you can rely on your existing social graph when messaging people on Telegram.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more information.<\/p>\n<p>You can use <strong>@GDPRbot<\/strong> to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request a copy of all your data that Telegram stores.<\/li>\n<li>Contact us about Data Privacy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Android users got a GDPR update with version 4.8.9 which allows more control over synced contacts and adds other privacy settings.\nOn June, 1, Apple approved Telegram v.4.8.2 for iOS with these features.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: There's illegal content on Telegram.\nHow do I take it down?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.<\/p>\n<p>But <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.\nIf you find sticker sets or bots on Telegram that you think are illegal, please ping us at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the 'report' buttons right inside our apps, see this post on our official @ISISwatch channel for details.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: If a scammer is pretending to be you, contact @NoToScam<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright.\nWhat do I do?\n<p>All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants.\nWe do not process any requests related to them.\nBut <strong>sticker sets<\/strong>, <strong>channels<\/strong>, and <strong>bots<\/strong> on Telegram are <em>publicly available<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org.\nPlease note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties?\n<p>Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet.\nTo do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal <strong>public<\/strong> content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app.\nFor example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots.<\/p>\n<p>User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI.\nWhenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that this does <strong>not<\/strong> apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech.\nFor example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship.\nThis goes against our founders' principles.\nWhile we do block terrorist (e.g.\nISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do I do?\n<p>If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at abuse@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you process data requests?\n<p>Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose.<\/p>\n<p>To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure.\nCloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions.\nThe relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect.\nAs a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression.\nTelegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.<\/p>\n<p>To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Telegram Basics\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can I write to?\n<p>You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram.\nAnother way of contacting people is to type their Telegram username into the search field.<\/p>\n<p>You can set a public username for your Telegram account too.\nOther people will be able to search and find you by that username — and send messages to you even if they don't know your number.\nYou can learn more about usernames here.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I know who in my contacts has Telegram?\n<p>Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts.\nThey also have pictures.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I invite my friends?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> The basic invitations are simple SMS messages.\nThey will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage).\nNaturally, you have other options to bring your friends here.\nTry sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it.\nThe link: <strong>\n<\/strong>\n<strong>https://telegram.org/dl/<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>Windows Phone:<\/em> Go to Contacts &gt.\nInvite Friends.\nThen choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can give your friends a t.me link with your username so that they can easily find you on Telegram even if they don't have your phone number.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do the check marks mean?\n<p>\n<em>One check<\/em> — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications.<br>\n<em>Two checks<\/em> — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message).<\/p>\n<p>We don't have a 'delivered to device' status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want.\nSo which particular one would that check mean?<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I hide my ‘last seen’ time?\n<p>You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own.\nYou will, however, see an approximate last seen value.\nThis keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram.\nThere are four possible approximate values:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen recently<\/strong> — covers anything between 1 second and 2-3 days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a week<\/strong> — between 2-3 and seven days<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen within a month<\/strong> — between 6-7 days and a month<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Last seen a long time ago<\/strong> — more than a month (this is also always shown to blocked users)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see me 'online'?\n<p>The last seen rules apply to your online status as well.\nPeople can only see you online if you're sharing your last seen status with them.<\/p>\n<p>There are some exceptions because sometimes it is obvious that you are online.\nRegardless of the last seen settings, people will see you online for a brief period (~30 seconds) if you do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send them a message in a one-on-one chat or in a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<li>Read a message they sent you in a one-on-one chat.<\/li>\n<li>Broadcast a “typing…” status to their chat with you or to a group where you both are members.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you're not sharing your last seen timestamp with someone and don't do anything of the above, they'll never see you online.\nAnother way of achieving this is to block that person.\n<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I delete my messages?\n<p>Yes.\nPreviously, you could unsend your messages within 48 hours after sending them.\nAs of Telegram 5.5, you can always delete any messages you sent or received in <em>any<\/em> one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own messages only).\nYou can also clear the entire chat history on both ends.\nOn Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.<\/p>\n<p>Together with privacy settings for forwarded messages, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder).\nAs a result, our users no longer need to worry about the data accumulating in their chats over the years.\nBoth parties in a conversation now have full control over what does and what doesn't belong to their online identity.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I make calls via Telegram?\n<p>Yes! Voice calls are currently available to users around the world.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How can I use emoticons in Telegram on my iOS device?\n<p>We support emoji emoticons.\nSimply enable the Emoji keyboard in your iOS device's Settings (General &gt.\nKeyboards &gt.\nAdd New Keyboard… &gt.\nEmoji).\nThen switch to that keyboard whenever you're out of words.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Groups and Channels\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What makes Telegram groups cool?\n<p>Telegram groups can have up to <strong>200,000 members<\/strong> each and are extremely powerful communication tools.\nHere are a few key features that make them stand out in the messaging world: <\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unified history<\/strong>\n<br>Edit your messages after posting, delete them so that they disappear for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cross-platform availability<\/strong>\n<br>Access your messages anytime, from any number of your mobile or desktop devices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Instant search<\/strong>\n<br>Find the message you're looking for, even among millions.\nFilter by sender to make searching easier.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Replies, mentions, hashtags<\/strong>\n<br>Easily trace a conversation and keep communication efficient, no matter the group size.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Smart notifications<\/strong>\n<br>Mute the group to get notifications only when people mention you or reply to your messages.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pinned messages<\/strong>\n<br>You can pin any message to be displayed at the top of the chat screen.\nAll members will get a notification — even if they muted ordinary messages from your group.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Moderation tools<\/strong>\n<br>Appoint administrators that can mass-delete messages, control membership, and pin important messages.\nDefine their admin privileges with granular precision.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Group permissions<\/strong>\n<br>Set default permissions to restrict all members from posting specific kinds of content.\nOr even restrict members from sending messages altogether – and let the admins chat amongst themselves while everybody else is watching.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>File sharing<\/strong>\n<br>Send and receive files of any type, up to 2 GB in size each, access them instantly on your other devices.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Public groups<\/strong>\n<br>Get a short link for your group and make it public, like t.me/publictestgroup.\nThis way, anybody can view the group's entire chat history and join to post messages.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customization via bots<\/strong>\n<br>Create custom tools for any specific needs using our Bot API and Inline Bots.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What's the difference between groups and channels?\n<p>Telegram <strong>groups<\/strong> are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams.\nBut groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members.\nYou can make any group <strong>public<\/strong>, toggle <strong>persistent history<\/strong> to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint <strong>administrators<\/strong> with granular privileges.\nYou can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Channels<\/strong> are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences.\nIn fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers.\nWhen you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your own.\nEach message in a channel has a <strong>view counter<\/strong> that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about channels in the Channels FAQ »<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a group?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Start a new message (tap the icon in the top right corner in Chats) &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Tap the circular pencil icon in the chat list &gt.\n'New Group'.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:<\/em> Click the menu button in the top left corner &gt.\n'New Group'.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I assign administrators?\n<p>You can add administrators to help you manage your group and define their privileges with granular precision.<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Go to Group Info (tap the photo in the top right corner on the group‘s chat screen) &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Go to Group Info (tap the name in the header) &gt.\nthe pencil icon (in the top right corner) &gt.\nAdministrators.<br>\n<em>Telegram Desktop:<\/em> When in the group, click '…' in the top right corner &gt.\nManage group &gt.\nAdministrators.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I add more members? What's an invite link?\n<p>You can add your contacts, or using search by username.<\/p>\n<p>It is easy to migrate existing groups to Telegram by sending people an <strong>invite link<\/strong>.\nTo create an invite link, go to Group Info &gt.\nAdd Member &gt.\nInvite to Group via Link.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who has Telegram installed will be able to join your group by following this link.\nIf you choose to revoke the link, it will stop working immediately.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read more about invite links in our blog »<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Usernames and t.me\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are usernames? How do I get one?\n<p>You can set up a <strong>public<\/strong> username on Telegram.\nIt then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username — you will appear in contacts search under 'global results'.\nPlease note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username in Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does t.me work?\n<p>Once you've set up a username, you can give people a t.me/username link.\nOpening that link on their phone will automatically fire up their Telegram app and open a chat with you.\nYou can share username links with friends, write them on business cards or put them up on your website.<\/p>\n<p>This way people can contact you on Telegram without knowing your phone number.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What can I use as my username?\n<p>You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores.\nUsernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g.\nTelegram and TeleGram is the same user).\nThe username must be at least five characters long.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need a username?\n<p>You don't have to get one.\nRemember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number.\nIf you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number?\n<p>No.\nNeither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your privacy settings).\nThis is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my username?\n<p>Go to Settings and save an empty username.\nThis will remove your username.\npeople will no longer be able to find you via search.\nThis will not affect existing conversations.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What do I do if my username is taken?\n<p>Telegram usernames are distributed on a first come — first serve basis.<\/p>\n<p>We understand that certain usernames are part of an online identity for some of us.\nIf your desired username is already taken, we will be happy to help you acquire it for your account or channel, provided that you have that same username on at least <strong>two<\/strong> of these services: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the fact that one account can register multiple bot and channel usernames, we reserve the right to recall usernames assigned to unused bots and channels, as well as openly squatted usernames.<\/p>\n<p>To request a username, contact @Username_bot.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if someone is pretending to be me?\n<p>If a scammer is pretending to be you, please contact @NoToScam.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Security\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are an advanced user, you may find our FAQ for the Technically Inclined useful as well.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How secure is Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line.\nWe are based on the MTProto protocol (see description and advanced FAQ), built upon time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections.\nWe are continuously working with the community to improve the security of our protocol and clients.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if I’m more paranoid than your regular user?\n<p>We've got you covered.\nTelegram’s special secret chats use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding.\nOn top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: So how do you encrypt data?\n<p>We support two layers of secure encryption.\nServer-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption.\nAll data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files.<\/p>\n<p>Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.\nYou can find more info in the Advanced FAQ.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Do you process data requests?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why should I trust you?\n<p>Telegram is open, anyone can check our source code, protocol and API, see how everything works and make an informed decision.\nTelegram supports verifiable builds, which allow experts to independently verify that our code published on GitHub is the <strong>exact same code<\/strong> that is used to build the apps you download from App Store or Google Play.<\/p>\n<p>We welcome security experts to audit our system and appreciate any feedback at security@telegram.org.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, Telegram's primary focus is not to bring a profit, so commercial interests will never interfere with our mission.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: articles about Telegram<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do I need to trust Telegram for this to be secure?\n<p>When it comes to secret chats, you don't — just make sure that the visualized key of your secret chat matches the one in your friend's secret chat settings.\nMore about this below.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What if my hacker friend says they could decipher Telegram messages?\n<p>Anyone who claims that Telegram messages can be deciphered is welcome to prove that claim in our competition and win $300,000.\nYou can check out the Cracking Contest Description to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>Any comments on Telegram's security are welcome at security@telegram.org.\nAll submissions which result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging from <strong>$100<\/strong> to <strong>$100,000<\/strong> or more, depending on the severity of the issue.\nPlease note that we can not offer bounties for issues that are disclosed to the public before they are fixed.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can Telegram protect me against everything?\n<p>Telegram can help when it comes to data transfer and secure communication.\nThis means that all data (including media and files) that you send and receive via Telegram cannot be deciphered when intercepted by your internet service provider, owners of Wi-Fi routers you connect to, or other third parties.<\/p>\n<p>But please remember that we cannot protect you from your own mother if she takes your unlocked phone without a passcode.\nOr from your IT-department if they access your computer at work.\nOr from any other people that get physical or root access to your phones or computers running Telegram.<\/p>\n<p>If you have reasons to worry about your personal security, we strongly recommend using only Secret Chats in official or at least verifiable open-source apps for sensitive information, preferably with a self-destruct timer.\nWe also recommend enabling 2-Step Verification and setting up a strong passcode to lock your app, you will find both options in Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does 2-Step Verification work?\n<p>Logging in with an SMS code is an industry standard in messaging, but if you're looking for more security or have reasons to doubt your mobile carrier or government, we recommend protecting your cloud chats with an additional password.<\/p>\n<p>You can do this in <strong>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\n2-Step Verification<\/strong>.\nOnce enabled, you will need both an SMS code and a password to log in.\nYou can also set up a recovery email address that will help regain access, should you forget your password.\nIf you do so, please remember that it's important that the recovery email account is also protected with a strong password and 2-Step Verification when possible.<\/p>\n<p>Check this out for tips on creating a strong password that is easy to remember.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous?\n<p>Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — root access.<\/p>\n<p>A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the internal storage.\nOnce an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile.\nNo application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Secret Chats\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How are secret chats different?\n<p>Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella.\nAll messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption.\nThis means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (more on this here).\nOn top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats.\nAnd when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well.<\/p>\n<p>You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient.\nThe message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices.<\/p>\n<p>All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud.\nThis means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin.\nThey are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I start a secret chat?\n<p>\n<em>iOS:<\/em> Open the profile of the user you want to contact.\nTap on ‘…’, then ‘Start Secret Chat’.<br>\n<em>Android:<\/em> Swipe right to open the menu, then 'New secret chat'.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific.\nIf you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device.\nIf you log out, you will lose all your secret chats.\nYou can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do self-destructing messages work?\n<p>The Self-Destruct Timer is available for <strong>all messages<\/strong> in Secret Chats and for <strong>media<\/strong> in private cloud chats.<\/p>\n<p>To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit.\nThe clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets two check marks).\nAs soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from <strong>both<\/strong> devices.\nWe will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent <strong>after<\/strong> the timer was set.\nIt has no effect on earlier messages.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I be certain that my conversation partner doesn't take a screenshot?\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices).\nWe will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently.\nWe advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust.\nAfter all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with a different device or an old school camera.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What is this 'Encryption Key' thing?\n<p>When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\nAfter the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat.\nYou can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app.<\/p>\n<p>Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not just make all chats 'secret'?\n<p>All Telegram messages are always securely encrypted.\nMessages in Secret Chats use <strong>client-client<\/strong> encryption, while Cloud Chats use <strong>client-server/server-client<\/strong> encryption and are stored encrypted in the Telegram Cloud (more here).\nThis enables your cloud messages to be both secure and immediately accessible from any of your devices – even if you lose your device altogether.<\/p>\n<p>The problem of restoring access to your chat history on a newly connected device (e.g.\nwhen you lose your phone) does not have an elegant solution in the end-to-end encryption paradigm.\nAt the same time, reliable backups are an essential feature for any mass-market messenger.\nTo solve this problem, some applications (like Whatsapp and Viber) allow decryptable backups that put their users' privacy at risk – even if they do not enable backups themselves.\nOther apps ignore the need for backups altogether and fade into oblivion before ever reaching a million users.<\/p>\n<p>We opted for a third approach by offering two distinct types of chats.\nTelegram disables default system backups and provides all users with an integrated security-focused backup solution in the form of Cloud Chats.\nMeanwhile, the separate entity of Secret Chats gives you full control over the data you do not want to be stored.<\/p>\n<p>This allows Telegram to be widely adopted in broad circles, not just by activists and dissidents, so that the simple fact of using Telegram does not mark users as targets for heightened surveillance in certain countries.\nWe are convinced that the separation of conversations into Cloud and Secret chats represents the most secure solution currently possible for a massively popular messaging application.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See also: Why Telegram isn't End-to-End Encrypted “by Default”<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Your Account\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Who can see my phone number?\n<p>On Telegram, you can send messages in private chats and groups without making your phone number visible.\nBy default, your number is only visible to people who you've added to your address book as contacts.\nYou can further modify this in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security &gt.\nPhone Number<\/em>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that people will always see your number if they know it already and <strong>saved<\/strong> it in their address book.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: I have a new phone number, what do I do?\n<p>Each phone number is a <strong>separate<\/strong> account on Telegram.\nYou have several options if you are using multiple phone numbers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you will <strong>no longer use the old number<\/strong> (e.g., you moved to a new country or changed your number for good), simply go to Settings and change the number connected to your Telegram account to the new number.\n<strong>Important:<\/strong> make sure you have access to your connected phone number – otherwise you risk losing access to your account.<\/li>\n<li>If you will use the new number for a <strong>limited time<\/strong> (e.g., you're on a trip or vacation), there's no need to do anything.<\/li>\n<li>If you want to keep using <strong>both numbers<\/strong> (e.g., you have a work phone and personal phone), choose one as your Telegram number.\nYou <em>may<\/em> create another Telegram account on the second number as well, for example, if you want to keep work and personal chats separated.\nIt is possible to log in to one Telegram app with up to <strong>3<\/strong> different accounts at once.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I log out?\n<p>Most users don't need to log out of Telegram:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use Telegram on many devices <strong>at the same time<\/strong>.\nJust use the same phone number to log in on all devices.<\/li>\n<li>You can go to <em>Settings &gt.\nData and Storage &gt.\nStorage Usage&gt.\nClear cache<\/em> to <strong>free up space<\/strong> on your device without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram with <strong>multiple phone numbers<\/strong>, you can switch between accounts without logging out.<\/li>\n<li>If you use Telegram on a <strong>shared device<\/strong>, you can set up a passcode in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security<\/em> to make sure only you have access to your account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you do want to log out for some reason, here's how you do that:<\/p>\n<p>\n<em>iOS<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\nEdit &gt.\nLog out.<br>\n<em>Android<\/em>, <em>Telegram Desktop<\/em>: Go to Settings &gt.\n… (in the top right corner) &gt.\nLog out.<\/p>\n<p>If you log out, you will keep all your cloud messages.\nHowever, you <strong>will lose<\/strong> all your <strong>Secret Chats<\/strong> and <strong>all messages<\/strong> inside those secret chats when you log out.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that logging out does <strong>not<\/strong> trigger remote deletion of your secret chat messages on your partner's device — to do that, choose 'Clear History' first.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I change my phone number?\n<p>You can change your number in Telegram and keep <strong>everything<\/strong>, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices.<\/p>\n<p>To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then 'Change Number'.\nIf you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account first.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I delete my account?\n<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page.\nDeleting your account permanently removes all your <strong>messages<\/strong> and <strong>contacts<\/strong>.\nAll groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights.<\/p>\n<p>This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend using a non-mobile browser for this process.<br>Note that you'll receive the <strong>code<\/strong> via <strong>Telegram<\/strong>, not SMS.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What happens if I delete my account?\n<p>As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted.\nThat said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have <em>their<\/em> copy of the messages you sent them.\nSo if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our self-destruct timer instead.<\/p>\n<p>Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible.\nIf you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back.\nPeople, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified.\nThe new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How does account self-destruction work?\n<p>Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space greatly.\nIf you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least six months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.\nYou can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: My phone was stolen, what do I do?\n<p>First of all, sorry about your phone.\nUnfortunately, the phone number is the only way for us to identify a Telegram user at the moment.\nWe don't collect additional information about you, so whoever has the number, has the account.\nThis means we can't help you unless you have access either to the phone number or to Telegram itself on any of your devices.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>I have access to Telegram on another device\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Telegram Settings &gt.\nPrivacy and Security and turn on Two-Step Verification.\nThis way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account.<\/li>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.\nWhoever has your phone will not be able to log in again, since they don't know your password.<\/li>\n<li>Contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>If you decide to switch to a new phone number, don't forget to go to Settings, tap on your phone number and change your Telegram number to the new one.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>I don't have access to Telegram on any other devices\n<ol>\n<li>First and foremost, you need to contact your phone provider, so that they block your old SIM and issue a new one with your number.<\/li>\n<li>Wait till you receive your new SIM with the old number, log in to Telegram, then go to Settings &gt.\nDevices (or Privacy &amp.\nSecurity &gt.\nActive Sessions) and terminate your Telegram session on the old device.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<i>\n<\/i>Removing sensitive data\n<p>Common thieves usually throw out the SIM card immediately (the phone is harder to locate this way), then wipe the devices and sell them, so there isn't much risk for the data in case of regular petty theft.\nBut if you have reasons to worry about the data on the device and are unable to log out the other device, it is best that you wipe it remotely.\nYou can read more about it here: Apple iOS, Android.\nUnfortunately, this requires you to have prepared in advance for this scenario.<\/p>\n<p>You can delete your Telegram account if you are logged in on at least one of your other devices (mobile or desktop).\nNote that inactive Telegram accounts self-destruct automatically after a period of time — 6 months being the default setting.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Bots\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you're a developer, you may find our Bots FAQ more useful.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: What are bots?\n<p>Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram.\nThey are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: How do I create a bot?\n<p>Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming.\nIf you're sure you're up to it, our <strong>Introduction for Developers<\/strong> is a good place to start.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer.\nBut we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop?\n<p>If you don't want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as you would block a human user.\nSome Telegram clients have a 'Stop Bot' button right in the bot's profile.<\/p>\n<p>That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its <em>/help<\/em> for clues.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots safe?\n<p>Yes.\nBots are no different from human users that you meet in groups for example.\nThey can see your public name, username, and profile pictures, and they can see messages you send to them, that's it.\nThey can't access your last seen status and <strong>don't<\/strong> see your phone number (unless you decide to give it to them yourself).<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, any bot should be treated as a stranger — don't give them your passwords, Telegram codes or bank account numbers, even if they ask nicely.\nAlso, be careful when opening files sent by bots, same as you would deal with ordinary humans.\nExample: If a bot sent us a file called <em>OpenMe.exe<\/em>, we probably wouldn't open it.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: If I add a bot to my group, can it read my messages?\n<p>Bots can work in two modes when you add them to groups.\nBy default, bots only see messages that are meant for them.\nIn this case, you'll see 'has no access to messages' in the group members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Some bots need more information to work, so developers may disable the privacy mode.\nIn this case, the bot will see all messages sent to the group, and you will see 'has access to messages' in the members list next to the bot.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about privacy mode for bots »<\/p>\n<p>If your group contains very sensitive information, maybe it's better to avoid adding bots you don't trust 100%.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Are bots made by Telegram?\n<p>No.\nWhile we have some official bots for specific purposes (like @gif or @GDPRbot), we don't usually make bots.\nBots are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API and platform.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Where can I find more bots?\n<p>There is no official store at the moment, so you'll have to ask your friends or search the web for now.\nWe're pretty sure you'll find some bots to play with.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Deeper questions\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why not open source everything?\n<p>All code will be released eventually.\nWe started with the most useful parts — a well-documented API that allows developers to build new Telegram apps, and open source clients that can be verified by security specialists.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I run Telegram using my own server?\n<p>Our architecture does not support federation yet.\nTelegram is a unified cloud service, so creating forks where two users might end up on two different Telegram clouds is unacceptable.\nTo enable you to run your own Telegram server while retaining both speed and security is a task in itself.\nAt the moment, we are undecided on whether or not Telegram should go in this direction.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I use the Telegram API?\n<p>Yes.\nDevelopers for all platforms are welcome to use our protocol, API and even source code.\nCheck out the Getting started section of the docs.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't forget about our Bot API that lets you build cool stuff on our platform.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Do you have a Privacy Policy?\n<p>Sure.\nCheck this out.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Why do you have two apps in the Mac App Store?\n<p>One is our app for macOS, the other is Telegram Lite, the macOS version of our multi-platform client.\nBoth apps are official.\nBoth started out as unofficial applications by two different developers and vary in design and functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram for macOS supports many platform-specific features, such as the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, gesture navigation, integration with the Mac's Share menu and more.\nIt has every feature from the iOS version of the app including Secret Chats.<\/p>\n<p>Telegram Lite is a lightning-fast app, optimized for work-related tasks and handling large communities.\nIt offers a three-column interface, perfect for multitasking and quick access to media, files and links shared in your chats.\nThis app can also be used to export your Telegram data and chats.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I translate Telegram?\n<p>Telegram is officially available in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Korean, Malay, Russian and Ukrainian on most platforms, and we are gradually expanding the list of languages built into the apps.<\/p>\n<p>If you don’t like how a specific element in Telegram's interface is translated in your language, or would like to help us maintain the translation, check out our localization platform.\nEveryone can suggest translations and vote for the best ones, making Telegram localization a community-driven effort.<\/p>\n<p>If you're looking to go beyond suggestions for individual phrases and would like to help us maintain the official translation to your language on a continuous basis, you can contact @TelegramAuditions.\nPlease include a hashtag with the English name of your language (e.g.\n#Albanian) and a few links to phrases on this platform with your <strong>translation suggestions<\/strong> or <strong>comments<\/strong>.\nBe sure read the <strong>Style Guide<\/strong> carefully before you apply.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Q: Can I help?\n<p>Yes, we are always looking for volunteers to help us with user support.\nIf you would be interested in answering questions about Telegram to users from your country, contact our auditions account.<\/p>\n<p>Before you apply, please check out the Telegram Support Initiative.<\/p>\n<i>\n<\/i>Passport\n<p>\n<strong>Telegram Passport<\/strong> is a unified authorization method for services that require personal identification.\nWith Telegram Passport, you can upload your documents once, then instantly share your data with services that require real-world ID (finance, ICOs, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>Your identity documents and personal data will be stored in the Telegram cloud using <strong>End-to-End Encryption<\/strong>.\nTo Telegram, this data is just random gibberish, and we have no access to the information you store in your Telegram Passport.\nWhen you

recording a video, or recording a voice/video message.<\/p>\n<p>Permission monitors on Samsung and Xiaomi can inadvertently flag and notify you that Telegram requested access to <strong>camera<\/strong> in the background.\nThis happens when the app requests info about the camera — it isn’t using the camera.\nUnfortunately it may look the same to the Samsung and Xiaomi permission monitors.<\/p>\n<p>Camera info is requested by the app when you tap on the attachment button, or start recording a video or a video message.\nIf you do this and quickly close the app, the already initiated request may try to run asynchronously when the app is already in the background, or be sent when the system wakes up the app to show a notification about a new message.\nIn any case, these requests are only for the camera info, the app <em>never<\/em> uses the camera itself in the background.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can check Telegram’s open source code and confirm that the app is not
