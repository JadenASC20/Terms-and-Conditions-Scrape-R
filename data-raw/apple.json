<\/dd>\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<dd>\n<p>\n<\/p>\n<\/dd>\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<dd>\n<p>These terms and conditions create a contract between you and Apple (the “Agreement”).\nPlease read the Agreement carefully.\nTo confirm your understanding and acceptance of the Agreement, click “Agree.”<\/p>\n<p>A.\nINTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES<\/p>\n<p>This Agreement governs your use of Apple’s services (“Services”), through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to content, Apps (as defined below), and other in-app services (collectively, “Content”).\nContent may be offered through the Services by Apple or a third party.\nOur Services are available for your use in your country or territory of residence (“Home Country”).\nBy&nbsp;creating an account for use of the Services in a particular country or territory you are specifying it as your Home Country.\nTo use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (fees may apply).\nOur Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.<\/p>\n<p>B.\nUSING OUR SERVICES<\/p>\n<p>PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS<\/p>\n<p>You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a “Transaction.” Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple, and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services.\nHowever, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd.\nis the merchant of record for the Content you acquire from certain Services (e.g., Apple Books, App Store, etc.) as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Service.\nIn such case, you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd., which is licensed by the Content provider (e.g., App Provider (as defined below), book publisher, etc.).\nWhen you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions.\nIf you enable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable Face ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facial recognition.\nManage your password settings at any time by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/HT204030.\nApple will charge your selected payment method (such as your credit card, debit card, gift card/code, or other method available in your Home Country) for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes.\nIf you have also added it to your Apple Wallet, Apple may charge your selected payment method in Apple Wallet using Apple Pay.\nIf we cannot charge your selected payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method again as you may update your payment method information.\nIf you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content’s availability).\nIn accordance with local law, Apple may update information regarding your selected payment method if provided such information by your financial institution.\nFor details about how Transactions are billed, please visit http://support.apple.com/HT5582.\nAll Transactions are final.\nContent prices may change at any time.\nIf technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple.\nFrom time to time, Apple may refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim.\nTerms related to Store Credit and gift cards/codes are available here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/.<\/p>\n<p>ACCOUNT&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Using our Services and accessing your Content may require an Apple ID.\nAn Apple ID is the account you use across Apple’s ecosystem.\nUse of Game Center is subject to this Agreement and also requires a Game Center account.\nYour account is valuable, and you are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security.\nApple is not responsible for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of your account.\nPlease contact Apple if you suspect that your account has been compromised.<\/p>\n<p>You must be age 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your Home Country, as set forth in the registration process) to create an account and use our Services.\nApple IDs for persons under this age can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing or by an approved educational institution.<\/p>\n<p>PRIVACY<\/p>\n<p>Your use of our Services is subject to Apple’s

owners.<\/p>\n<p>- You can use Content from up to five different Apple IDs on each device.<\/p>\n<p>- For any Service, you can have up to 10 devices (but only a maximum of 5 computers) signed in with your Apple ID at one time, though simultaneous streams or downloads of Content may be limited to a lower number of devices as set out below under Apple Music and Apple TV content.\nEach computer must

those computers.<\/p>\n<p>- Content rentals are viewable on a single device at a time, and must be played within 30 days, and completed within 48 hours of the start of play (stopping, pausing or restarting does not extend this period).<\/p>\n<p>- You may burn an audio playlist of purchased music to disc for listening purposes up to seven times.\nthis limitation does not apply to DRM-free Content.&nbsp.\nOther Content may not be burned to disc.<\/p>\n<p>App Store Content:<\/p>\n<p>- The term “Apps” includes apps and app clips for any Apple platform and/or operating system, including

governmental organization or educational institution (an “Enterprise”) may download and sync non-Arcade Apps for use by either (i) a single individual on one or more devices owned or controlled by an Enterprise.\nor (ii) multiple individuals on a single shared device owned or controlled by an Enterprise.\nFor the sake of clarity, each device used serially or collectively by multiple users requires a separate license.<\/p>\n<p>Apple Music:<\/p>\n<p>- An Individual Apple Music membership allows you to stream on a single device at a time.\na Family membership allows you or your Family members to stream on up to six devices at a time.<\/p>\n<p>Apple Arcade:<\/p>\n<p>- Apple Arcade Apps may only be downloaded, or redownloaded, with a valid Apple Arcade trial or subscription.<\/p>\n<p>- If your

may be able to redownload previously acquired Content (“Redownload”) to your devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID (“Associated Devices”).\nYou can see Content types available for Redownload in your Home Country at https://support.apple.com/HT204632.\nContent may not be available for Redownload if that Content is no longer offered on our Services.<\/p>\n<p>SUBSCRIPTIONS<\/p>\n<p>The Services and certain Apps may allow you to purchase access to Content or Services on a subscription basis (“Paid Subscriptions”).\nPaid Subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings.\nTo learn more about cancelling your subscriptions, visit

prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period.\nIf we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled the Paid Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information.\nThis may result in a change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period.&nbsp.\nWe reserve the right to cancel your Paid Subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription.&nbsp.\nCertain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method.\nIf you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start charging your payment method, cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the free trial ends.\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you start a free trial to a Paid Subscription offered by Apple as Content provider (an “Apple Paid Subscription”) and cancel before it ends, you cannot reactivate the free trial.<\/p>\n<p>Free trials or free offers to Apple Paid Subscriptions, excluding iCloud, cannot be combined with any free trials or offers of Apple One.\n&nbsp;If you are in a free trial or free offer for any Apple Paid Subscriptions, and you subscribe to Apple One, your

APPS)<\/p>\n<p>LICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>App licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”).\nIf you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International Ltd., which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International Ltd., but the App is licensed by the App Provider.\nAn App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in providing the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider.\nAny App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”).\nThe App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement.\nCertain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.<\/p>\n<p>IN-APP PURCHASES<\/p>\n<p>Apps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”).\nIn-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the

https://support.apple.com/HT201304.<\/p>\n<p>APP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT<\/p>\n<p>Apple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law.\nApp Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.<\/p>\n<p>APP BUNDLES<\/p>\n<p>Some Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”).\nThe price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle.\nThe App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle.<\/p>\n<p>LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT<\/p>\n<p>Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you.\nYour

Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of that Third Party App.\nAny App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.<\/p>\n<p>a.\nScope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules.\nThe terms of this Standard EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA.\nExcept as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time.\nYou may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so.\nYou may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).<\/p>\n<p>b.\nConsent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application.\nLicensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.<\/p>\n<p>c.\nTermination.\nThis Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor.\nYour rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.<\/p>\n<p>d.\nExternal Services.\nThe Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, \"External Services\").\nYou agree to use the External Services at your sole risk.\nLicensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services.\nData displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents.\nYou will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party.\nYou agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use.\nExternal Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location.\nTo the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws.\nLicensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.<\/p>\n<p>e.\nNO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS.\nNO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.\nSHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<\/p>\n<p>f.\nLimitation of Liability.\nTO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nIn no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\nThe foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.<\/p>\n<p>g.\nYou may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensed Application was obtained.\nIn particular, but without limitation, the Licensed Application may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S.\nTreasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or

of \"Commercial Computer Software\" and \"Commercial Computer Software Documentation\", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R.\n§12.212 or 48 C.F.R.\n§227.7202, as applicable.\nConsistent with 48

CERTAIN CONTENT ACQUIRED FROM THIRD PARTIES<\/p>\n<p>Some Content available in certain Services are acquired by You from the third-party provider of such Content (as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Content), not Apple.&nbsp.\nFor example, Apple Books Content is acquired from book publishers, not Apple.\nIn such case, Apple acts as an agent

important to Apple so we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, we provide data and privacy information imbedded in our products connected with our Data &amp.\nPrivacy Icon for certain features that ask to use your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>You can review this information before enabling these features, in Settings related to those features and/or online at apple.com/legal/privacy.\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and contact us if you have any questions.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nYour California Privacy Disclosures&nbsp;<br>\nInformation Regarding Commercial Electronic Messages in Canada<br>\nApple Health Research Apps Privacy Policy<br>\n<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<dd> Collection and Use of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.<\/p>\n<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company.\nApple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nThey may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\nYou are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\nWhat personal information we collect\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.<\/li>\n<li>When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.\nApple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.<\/li>\n<li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHow we use your personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.\nIf you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.\nIf you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.<\/li>\n<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\nWe may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\nWhere we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.\nWe limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.<\/li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.\nFor example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.\nBecause this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<\/li>\n<li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSource of your personal information where they are not collected from you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.<\/li>\n<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.<\/p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.<\/p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.\nThese companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.<\/p>\nOthers\n<p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information.\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWith the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.<\/p>\n<p>When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances.\nFor example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.\nPlease take care when using these features.<\/p>\n<p>If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family—including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases—may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information.\nVisit Family Sharing for more information.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nThe Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling\n<p>Apple does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.<\/p>\nIntegrity and Retention of Personal Information\n<p>Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.\nWe will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries.\nWhen assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nYour Privacy Rights\n<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by signing in to your Apple ID account page.\nFor other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.\nWe may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier.\nOnline tools for the exercise of access, deactivation/restriction, correction, or deletion requests are available on a regional basis by signing in to privacy.apple.com.\nFor users with Shazam accounts sign in to www.shazam.com/privacy.\nWhen you make a request using these online tools, we will verify your identity and the legitimacy of your request.<\/p>\nCalifornia\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act provides California consumers with the right to obtain from Apple information about the personal information about you that we collect, use, and disclose.\nYou can exercise your rights through an authorized agent by providing relevant details to allow sign in to privacy.apple.com.\nIf you cannot access Apple’s online tools, you or your agent can make a request to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to exercise your privacy rights, you have the right to not to receive discriminatory treatment or a lesser degree of service from Apple.<\/p>\nNevada\n<p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.\nApple does not sell your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>See our page on understanding and controlling your personal information for more information on exercising your rights.\nWhere the online tool is not currently available for access requests in your region, a request may be made directly to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.<\/p>\nChildren &amp.\nEducation\n<p>We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services.\nChildren under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school.\nFor example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple’s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child’s Information.\nand the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child.\nIn addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed Apple IDs for students.\nThe Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple handles student information and supplements Apple’s Privacy Policy.\nLearn more about Family Sharing, the Managed Apple IDs and Restrictions for children’s accounts.\nIf we learn that we have collected the personal information of a

access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child’s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.<\/p>\nLocation-Based Services\n<p>To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees, such as maps data providers, may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device.\nWhere available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location.\nUnless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services.\nFor example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.<\/p>\n<p>Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the “Find My” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work.<\/p>\nThird‑Party Sites and Services\n<p>Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services.\nOur products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third‑party iPhone app.<\/p>\n<p>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices.\nWe encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.<\/p>\n<p>If you purchase a subscription in a third party app or within News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher which we use to provide reports to the developer or publisher that include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence.\nIf you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe.\nThis information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.<\/p>\nInternational Transfers\n<p>All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy.\nPersonal information, relating to Apple services, regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland, and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc.\nApple uses approved Model Contractual Clauses for the international transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\nApple, as a global company, has a number of legal entities in different jurisdictions which are responsible for the personal information which they collect and which is processed on their behalf by Apple Inc.\nFor example, point of sale information in our Retail entities outside the U.S.\nis controlled by our individual Retail entities in each country.\nApple, Online Store and iTunes related personal information may also be controlled by legal entities outside the U.S.\nas reflected in the terms of each service.\nImagery and associated data collected by Apple around the world to improve Apple Maps, and in support of our Look Around feature is transferred to Apple Inc in California.<\/p>\n<p>Apple abides by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules System.\nThe APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies.\nIf you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern regarding our APEC CBPR and/or PRP certifications please visit our third-party dispute resolution provider.<\/p>\nOur Companywide Commitment to Your&nbsp;Privacy\n<p>To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Apple employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.<\/p>\nPrivacy Questions\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about

us.\nYou can always contact us by phone at the relevant Apple Support number for your country or region.<\/p>\n<p>When a privacy question or question about personal information received in response to an access/download request is received we have a dedicated team which triages your contact to address your issue.\nWhere your issue may be more substantive in nature, we may request more information from you.\nAll such substantive contacts receive a response within seven (7), days wherever possible - providing a response on the issue raised, requesting additional information where necessary or indicating that a response will require additional time.\nYou may at any time refer your complaint to the relevant regulator in your jurisdiction if you are unsatisfied with a reply received from us.\nIf you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Where your complaint indicates an improvement could be made in our handling of privacy issues we will take steps to make such an update at the next reasonable opportunity.\nIn the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a negative impact on you or another person we will take steps to address that with you or that other person.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may update its Privacy Policy from time to time.\nWhen we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.\nWe will also contact you via your contact information on file, for example by email, notification or some

confirm your understanding and acceptance of the Agreement, click “Agree.”<\/p>\n<p>A.\nINTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES<\/p>\n<p>This Agreement governs your use of Apple’s services (“Services”), through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to content, Apps (as defined below), and other in-app services (collectively, “Content”).\nContent may be offered through the Services by Apple or a third party.\nOur Services are available for your use in your country or territory of residence (“Home Country”).\nBy&nbsp;creating an account for use of the Services in a particular country or territory you are specifying it as your Home Country.\nTo use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (fees may apply).\nOur Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.<\/p>\n<p>B.\nUSING OUR SERVICES<\/p>\n<p>PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS<\/p>\n<p>You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a “Transaction.” Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple, and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services.\nHowever, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd.\nis the merchant of record for the Content you acquire from certain Services (e.g., Apple Books, App Store, etc.) as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Service.\nIn such case, you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd., which is licensed by the Content provider (e.g., App Provider (as defined below), book publisher, etc.).\nWhen you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions.\nIf you enable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable Face ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facial recognition.\nManage your password settings at any time by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/HT204030.\nApple will charge your selected payment method (such as your credit card, debit card, gift card/code, or other method available in your Home Country) for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes.\nIf you have also added it to your Apple Wallet, Apple may charge your selected payment method in Apple Wallet using Apple Pay.\nIf we cannot charge your selected payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method again as you may update your payment method information.\nIf you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content’s availability).\nIn accordance with local law, Apple may update information regarding your selected payment method if provided such information by your financial institution.\nFor details about how Transactions are billed, please visit http://support.apple.com/HT5582.\nAll Transactions are final.\nContent prices may change at any time.\nIf technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple.\nFrom time to time, Apple may refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim.\nTerms related to Store Credit and gift cards/codes are available here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/.<\/p>\n<p>ACCOUNT&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Using our Services and accessing your Content may require an Apple ID.\nAn Apple ID is the account you use across Apple’s ecosystem.\nUse of Game Center is subject to this Agreement and also requires a Game Center account.\nYour account is valuable, and you are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security.\nApple is not responsible for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of your account.\nPlease contact Apple if you suspect that your account has been compromised.<\/p>\n<p>You must be age 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your Home Country, as set forth in the registration process) to create an account and use our Services.\nApple IDs for persons

governmental organization or educational institution (an “Enterprise”) may download and sync non-Arcade Apps for use by either (i) a single individual on one or more devices owned or controlled by an Enterprise.\nor (ii) multiple individuals on a single shared device owned or controlled by an Enterprise.\nFor the sake of clarity, each device used serially or collectively by multiple users requires

prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period.\nIf we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled the Paid Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information.\nThis may result in a change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period.&nbsp.\nWe reserve the right to cancel your Paid Subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription.&nbsp.\nCertain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method.\nIf you decide to unsubscribe from a

the App Provider.\nAn App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in providing the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider.\nAny App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”).\nThe App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement.\nCertain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.<\/p>\n<p>IN-APP PURCHASES<\/p>\n<p>Apps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”).\nIn-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the

https://support.apple.com/HT201304.<\/p>\n<p>APP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT<\/p>\n<p>Apple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law.\nApp Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.<\/p>\n<p>APP BUNDLES<\/p>\n<p>Some Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”).\nThe price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle.\nThe App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle.<\/p>\n<p>LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT<\/p>\n<p>Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you.\nYour

Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of that Third Party App.\nAny App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.<\/p>\n<p>a.\nScope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules.\nThe terms of this Standard EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA.\nExcept as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time.\nYou may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so.\nYou may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).<\/p>\n<p>b.\nConsent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application.\nLicensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.<\/p>\n<p>c.\nTermination.\nThis Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor.\nYour rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.<\/p>\n<p>d.\nExternal Services.\nThe Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, \"External Services\").\nYou agree to use the External Services at your sole risk.\nLicensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services.\nData displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents.\nYou will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party.\nYou agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use.\nExternal Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location.\nTo the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws.\nLicensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.<\/p>\n<p>e.\nNO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS.\nNO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.\nSHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<\/p>\n<p>f.\nLimitation of Liability.\nTO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR

important to Apple so we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, we provide data and privacy information imbedded in our products connected with our Data &amp.\nPrivacy Icon for certain features that ask to use your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>You can review this information before enabling these features, in Settings related to those features and/or online at apple.com/legal/privacy.\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy

Research Apps Privacy Policy<br>\n<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<dd> Collection and Use of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.<\/p>\n<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company.\nApple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nThey may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\nYou are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\nWhat personal information we collect\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.<\/li>\n<li>When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.\nApple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.<\/li>\n<li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHow we use your personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.\nIf you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.\nIf you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.<\/li>\n<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\nWe may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\nWhere we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.\nWe limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.<\/li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.\nFor example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.\nBecause this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<\/li>\n<li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSource of your personal information where they are not collected from you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.<\/li>\n<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information

protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services.\nChildren under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school.\nFor example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple’s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child’s Information.\nand the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child.\nIn addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and

Research Apps Privacy Policy<br>\n<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<dd> Collection and Use of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.<\/p>\n<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company.\nApple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nThey may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\nYou are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\nWhat personal information we collect\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.<\/li>\n<li>When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.\nApple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.<\/li>\n<li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHow we use your personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.\nIf you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.\nIf you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.<\/li>\n<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\nWe may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\nWhere we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.\nWe limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.<\/li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.\nFor example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.\nBecause this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<\/li>\n<li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSource of your personal information where they are not collected from you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.<\/li>\n<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.<\/p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.<\/p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services

disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWith the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.<\/p>\n<p>When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal

review this information before enabling these features, in Settings related to those features and/or online at apple.com/legal/privacy.\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and contact us if you have any questions.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nYour California Privacy Disclosures&nbsp;<br>\nInformation Regarding Commercial Electronic Messages in Canada<br>\nApple Health Research Apps Privacy Policy<br>\n<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<dd> Collection and Use of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.<\/p>\n<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company.\nApple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nThey may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\nYou are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\nWhat personal information we collect\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.<\/li>\n<li>When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.\nApple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.<\/li>\n<li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHow we use your personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.\nIf you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.\nIf you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.<\/li>\n<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\nWe may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\nWhere we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.\nWe limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.<\/li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.\nFor example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.\nBecause this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<\/li>\n<li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSource of your personal information where they are not collected from you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.<\/li>\n<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.<\/p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.<\/p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.\nThese companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.<\/p>\nOthers\n<p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information.\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWith the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.<\/p>\n<p>When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances.\nFor example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.\nPlease take care when using these features.<\/p>\n<p>If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family—including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases—may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information.\nVisit Family Sharing for more information.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nThe Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling\n<p>Apple does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.<\/p>\nIntegrity and Retention of Personal Information\n<p>Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.\nWe will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries.\nWhen assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nYour Privacy Rights\n<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by signing in to your Apple ID account page.\nFor other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.\nWe may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier.\nOnline tools for the exercise of access, deactivation/restriction, correction, or deletion requests are available on a regional basis by signing in to privacy.apple.com.\nFor users with Shazam accounts sign in to www.shazam.com/privacy.\nWhen you make a request using these online tools, we will verify your identity and the legitimacy of your request.<\/p>\nCalifornia\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act provides California consumers with the right to obtain from Apple information about the personal information about you that we collect, use, and disclose.\nYou can exercise your rights through an authorized agent by providing relevant details to allow sign in to privacy.apple.com.\nIf you cannot access Apple’s online tools,

Research Apps Privacy Policy<br>\n<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<dd> Collection and Use of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.<\/p>\n<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company.\nApple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nThey may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\nYou are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\nWhat personal information we collect\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.<\/li>\n<li>When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.\nApple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.<\/li>\n<li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHow we use your personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.\nIf you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.\nIf you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.<\/li>\n<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\nWe may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\nWhere we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.\nWe limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.<\/li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.\nFor example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.\nBecause this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<\/li>\n<li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSource of your personal information where they are not collected from you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.<\/li>\n<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.<\/p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.<\/p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.\nThese companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.<\/p>\nOthers\n<p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information.\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWith the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.<\/p>\n<p>When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances.\nFor example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.\nPlease take care when using these features.<\/p>\n<p>If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family—including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases—may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information.\nVisit Family Sharing for more information.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nThe Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling\n<p>Apple does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.<\/p>\nIntegrity and Retention of Personal Information\n<p>Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.\nWe will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries.\nWhen assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nYour Privacy Rights\n<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by signing in to your Apple ID account page.\nFor other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.\nWe may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier.\nOnline tools for the exercise of access, deactivation/restriction, correction, or deletion requests are available on a regional basis by signing in to privacy.apple.com.\nFor users with Shazam accounts sign in to www.shazam.com/privacy.\nWhen you make a request using these online tools, we will verify your identity and the legitimacy of your request.<\/p>\nCalifornia\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act provides California consumers with the right to obtain from Apple information about the personal information about you that we collect, use, and disclose.\nYou can exercise your rights through an authorized agent by providing relevant details to allow sign in to privacy.apple.com.\nIf you cannot access Apple’s online tools, you or your agent can make a request to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to exercise your privacy rights, you have the right to not to receive discriminatory treatment or a lesser degree of service from Apple.<\/p>\nNevada\n<p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.\nApple does not sell your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>See our page on understanding and controlling your personal information for more information on exercising your rights.\nWhere the online tool is not currently available for access requests in your region, a request may be made directly to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.<\/p>\nChildren &amp.\nEducation\n<p>We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services.\nChildren under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school.\nFor example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple’s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child’s Information.\nand the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child.\nIn addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed Apple IDs for students.\nThe Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple handles student information and supplements Apple’s Privacy Policy.\nLearn more about Family Sharing, the Managed Apple IDs and Restrictions for children’s accounts.\nIf we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.\nIf at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child’s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.<\/p>\nLocation-Based Services\n<p>To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees, such as maps data providers, may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device.\nWhere available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location.\nUnless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services.\nFor example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.<\/p>\n<p>Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the “Find My” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work.<\/p>\nThird‑Party Sites and Services\n<p>Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services.\nOur products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third‑party iPhone app.<\/p>\n<p>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices.\nWe encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.<\/p>\n<p>If you purchase a subscription in a third party app or within News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher which we use to provide reports to the developer or publisher that include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence.\nIf you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe.\nThis information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.<\/p>\nInternational Transfers\n<p>All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy.\nPersonal information, relating to Apple services, regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland, and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc.\nApple uses approved Model Contractual Clauses for the international transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\nApple, as a global company, has a number of legal entities in different jurisdictions which are responsible for the personal information which they collect and which is processed on their behalf by Apple Inc.\nFor example, point of sale information in our Retail entities outside the U.S.\nis controlled by our individual Retail entities in each country.\nApple, Online Store and iTunes related personal information may also be controlled by legal entities outside the U.S.\nas reflected in the terms of each service.\nImagery and associated data collected by Apple around the world to improve Apple Maps, and in support of our Look Around feature is transferred to Apple Inc in California.<\/p>\n<p>Apple abides by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules System.\nThe APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies.\nIf you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern regarding our APEC CBPR and/or PRP certifications please visit our third-party dispute resolution provider.<\/p>\nOur Companywide Commitment to Your&nbsp;Privacy\n<p>To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Apple employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.<\/p>\nPrivacy Questions\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about Apple’s Privacy Policy or data processing, you would like to contact our Data Protection Officer, or if you would like to make a complaint about a possible breach of local privacy laws, please contact us.\nYou can always contact us by phone at the relevant Apple Support number for your country or region.<\/p>\n<p>When a privacy question or question about personal information received in response to an access/download request is received we have a dedicated team which triages your contact to address your issue.\nWhere your issue may be more substantive in nature, we may request more information from you.\nAll such substantive contacts receive a response within seven (7), days wherever possible - providing a response on the issue raised, requesting additional information where necessary or indicating that a response will require additional time.\nYou may at any time refer your complaint to the relevant regulator in your jurisdiction if you are unsatisfied with a reply received from us.\nIf you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Where your complaint indicates an improvement could be made in our handling of privacy issues we will take steps to make such an update at the next reasonable opportunity.\nIn the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a negative impact on you or another person we will take steps to address that with you or that other person.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may update its Privacy Policy from time to time.\nWhen we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.\nWe will also contact you via your contact information on file, for example by email, notification or some

customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you

you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our

combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted

information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the

information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.<\/p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic

eliminate messages sent to customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.<\/p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.\nThese companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.<\/p>\nOthers\n<p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information.\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWith the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.<\/p>\n<p>When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances.\nFor example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.\nPlease take care when using these features.<\/p>\n<p>If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family—including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases—may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information.\nVisit Family Sharing for more information.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nThe Existence of

the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries.\nWhen assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nYour Privacy Rights\n<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by signing in to your Apple ID account page.\nFor other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.\nWe may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier.\nOnline tools for the exercise of access, deactivation/restriction, correction, or deletion requests are available on a regional basis by signing in to privacy.apple.com.\nFor users with Shazam accounts sign in to www.shazam.com/privacy.\nWhen you make a request using these online tools, we will verify your identity and the legitimacy of your

protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services.\nChildren under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school.\nFor example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple’s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child’s Information.\nand the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child.\nIn addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed Apple IDs for students.\nThe Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple handles student information and supplements Apple’s Privacy Policy.\nLearn more about Family Sharing, the Managed Apple IDs and Restrictions for children’s accounts.\nIf we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.\nIf at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child’s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.<\/p>\nLocation-Based Services\n<p>To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees, such as maps data providers, may collect, use, and share precise

crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location.\nUnless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services.\nFor example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.<\/p>\n<p>Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the “Find My” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work.<\/p>\nThird‑Party Sites and Services\n<p>Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services.\nOur products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third‑party iPhone app.<\/p>\n<p>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices.\nWe encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.<\/p>\n<p>If you purchase a subscription in a third party app or within News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher which we use to provide reports to the developer or publisher that include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence.\nIf you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe.\nThis information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.<\/p>\nInternational Transfers\n<p>All the

Research Apps Privacy Policy<br>\n<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<dd> Collection and Use of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.<\/p>\n<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company.\nApple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nThey may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\nYou are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\nWhat personal information we collect\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact

purposes.<\/li>\n<li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHow we use your personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.\nIf you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.\nIf you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.<\/li>\n<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\nWe may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\nWhere we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.\nWe limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.<\/li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.\nFor example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.\nBecause this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<\/li>\n<li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSource of your personal information where they are not collected from you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.<\/li>\n<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.<\/p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.<\/p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services

disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such

include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence.\nIf you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe.\nThis information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.<\/p>\nInternational Transfers\n<p>All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy.\nPersonal information, relating to Apple services, regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland, and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc.\nApple uses approved Model Contractual Clauses for the international transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\nApple, as a global company, has a number of legal entities in different jurisdictions which are responsible for the personal information which they collect and which is processed on their behalf by Apple Inc.\nFor example, point of sale information in our Retail entities outside the U.S.\nis controlled by our individual Retail entities in each country.\nApple, Online Store and iTunes related personal information may also be

an access/download request is received we have a dedicated team which triages your contact to address your issue.\nWhere your issue may be more substantive in nature, we may request more information from you.\nAll such substantive contacts receive a response within seven (7), days wherever possible - providing a response on the issue raised, requesting additional information where necessary or indicating that a response will require additional time.\nYou may at any time refer your complaint to the relevant regulator in your jurisdiction if you are unsatisfied with a reply received from us.\nIf you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Where your complaint indicates an improvement could be made in our handling of privacy issues we will take steps to make such an update at the next reasonable opportunity.\nIn the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a negative impact on you or another person we will take steps to address that with you or that other person.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may update its Privacy Policy from time to time.\nWhen we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.\nWe will also contact you via your contact information on file, for example by email, notification or some

information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.<\/p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.<\/p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.\nThese companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.<\/p>\nOthers\n<p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information.\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWith the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.<\/p>\n<p>When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances.\nFor example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.\nPlease take care when using these features.<\/p>\n<p>If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family—including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases—may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information.\nVisit Family Sharing for more information.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nThe Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling\n<p>Apple does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.<\/p>\nIntegrity and Retention of Personal Information\n<p>Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.\nWe will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries.\nWhen assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nYour Privacy Rights\n<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by signing in to your Apple ID account page.\nFor other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.\nWe may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier.\nOnline tools for the exercise of access, deactivation/restriction, correction, or deletion requests are available on a regional basis by signing in to privacy.apple.com.\nFor users with Shazam accounts sign in to www.shazam.com/privacy.\nWhen you make a request using these online tools, we will verify your identity and the legitimacy of your request.<\/p>\nCalifornia\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act provides California consumers with the right to obtain from Apple information about the personal information about you that we collect, use, and disclose.\nYou can exercise your rights through an authorized agent by providing relevant details to allow sign in to privacy.apple.com.\nIf you cannot access Apple’s online tools, you or your agent can make a request to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to exercise your privacy rights, you have the right to not to receive discriminatory treatment or a lesser degree of service from Apple.<\/p>\nNevada\n<p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.\nApple does not sell your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>See our page on understanding and controlling your personal information for more information on exercising your rights.\nWhere the online tool is not currently available for access requests in your region, a request may be made directly to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.<\/p>\nChildren &amp.\nEducation\n<p>We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services.\nChildren under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school.\nFor example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple’s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child’s Information.\nand the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child.\nIn addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed Apple IDs for students.\nThe Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple handles student information and supplements Apple’s Privacy Policy.\nLearn more about Family Sharing, the Managed Apple IDs and Restrictions for children’s accounts.\nIf we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.\nIf at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child’s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.<\/p>\nLocation-Based Services\n<p>To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees, such as maps data providers, may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device.\nWhere available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location.\nUnless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services.\nFor example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.<\/p>\n<p>Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the “Find My” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work.<\/p>\nThird‑Party Sites and Services\n<p>Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services.\nOur products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third‑party iPhone app.<\/p>\n<p>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices.\nWe encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.<\/p>\n<p>If you purchase a subscription in a third party app or within News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher which we use to provide reports to the developer or publisher that include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence.\nIf you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe.\nThis information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.<\/p>\nInternational Transfers\n<p>All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy.\nPersonal information, relating to Apple services, regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland, and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc.\nApple uses approved Model Contractual Clauses for the international transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\nApple, as a global company, has a number of legal entities in different jurisdictions which are responsible for the personal information which they collect and which is processed on their behalf by Apple Inc.\nFor example, point of sale information in our Retail entities outside the U.S.\nis controlled by our individual Retail entities in each country.\nApple, Online Store and iTunes related personal information may also be controlled by legal entities outside the U.S.\nas reflected in the terms of each service.\nImagery and associated data collected by Apple around the world to improve Apple Maps, and in support of our Look Around feature is transferred to Apple Inc in California.<\/p>\n<p>Apple abides by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules System.\nThe APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies.\nIf you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern regarding our APEC CBPR and/or PRP certifications please visit our third-party dispute resolution provider.<\/p>\nOur Companywide Commitment to Your&nbsp;Privacy\n<p>To make sure your personal information is secure, we

improvement could be made in our handling of privacy issues we will take steps to make such an update at the next reasonable opportunity.\nIn the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a negative impact on you or another person we will take steps to address that with you or that other person.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may update its Privacy Policy from time to time.\nWhen we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.\nWe will also contact you via your contact information on file, for example by email, notification or some other equivalent method.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Apple Inc.\nOne Apple Park Way, Cupertino, California, USA, 95014<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/dd>\n<\/dl> ","created_at":"2018-07-17

territory you are specifying it as your Home Country.\nTo use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (fees may apply).\nOur Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.<\/p>\n<p>B.\nUSING OUR SERVICES<\/p>\n<p>PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS<\/p>\n<p>You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a “Transaction.” Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple, and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services.\nHowever, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd.\nis the merchant of record for the Content you acquire from certain Services (e.g., Apple Books, App Store, etc.) as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Service.\nIn such case, you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd., which is licensed by the Content provider (e.g., App Provider (as defined below), book publisher, etc.).\nWhen you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions.\nIf you enable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable Face ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facial recognition.\nManage your password settings at any time by following these instructions:

Transactions, including any applicable taxes.\nIf you have also added it to your Apple Wallet, Apple may charge your selected payment method in Apple Wallet using Apple Pay.\nIf we cannot charge your

other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim.\nTerms related to Store Credit and gift cards/codes are available here:

APPS)<\/p>\n<p>LICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>App licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”).\nIf you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International Ltd., which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International Ltd., but the App is licensed by the App Provider.\nAn App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in providing the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider.\nAny App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”).\nThe App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement.\nCertain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.<\/p>\n<p>IN-APP PURCHASES<\/p>\n<p>Apps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”).\nIn-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once.\nYou must authenticate your account before making In-App Purchases – separate from any authentication to obtain other Content – by entering your password or using Touch ID or Face ID.\nYou will be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-authenticating unless you’ve asked us to require a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID or Face ID.\nYou can turn off the ability to make In-App Purchases by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/HT201304.<\/p>\n<p>APP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT<\/p>\n<p>Apple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law.\nApp Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.<\/p>\n<p>APP BUNDLES<\/p>\n<p>Some Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”).\nThe price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle.\nThe App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle.<\/p>\n<p>LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT<\/p>\n<p>Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you.\nYour license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the

Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of that Third Party App.\nAny App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.<\/p>\n<p>a.\nScope of License:

source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).<\/p>\n<p>b.\nConsent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and

Services.\nData displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents.\nYou will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party.\nYou agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use.\nExternal Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location.\nTo the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws.\nLicensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.<\/p>\n<p>e.\nNO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,

RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<\/p>\n<p>f.\nLimitation of Liability.\nTO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nIn no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\nThe foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.<\/p>\n<p>g.\nYou may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensed Application was obtained.\nIn particular, but without limitation, the Licensed Application may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S.\nTreasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or

CERTAIN CONTENT ACQUIRED FROM THIRD PARTIES<\/p>\n<p>Some Content available in certain Services are acquired by You from the third-party provider of such Content (as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Content), not Apple.&nbsp.\nFor example, Apple Books Content is acquired from book publishers, not Apple.\nIn such case, Apple acts as an agent for the Content provider in providing the Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction between you and the Content provider.\nHowever, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd.\nis the merchant of record for the Content you acquire from certain Services (e.g., Apple Books), but such Content is licensed by the Content provider.&nbsp.\nThe Content provider reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating to such Content.\nThe Content provider is solely responsible for such Content, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to such Content.<\/p>\n<p>I.\nADDITIONAL APPLE MUSIC TERMS<\/p>\n<p>iCloud

important to Apple so we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, we provide data and privacy information imbedded in our products connected with our Data &amp.\nPrivacy Icon for certain features that ask to use your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>You can review this information before enabling these features, in Settings related to those features and/or online at apple.com/legal/privacy.\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and contact us if you have any questions.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nYour California Privacy Disclosures&nbsp;<br>\nInformation Regarding Commercial Electronic Messages in Canada<br>\nApple Health Research Apps Privacy Policy<br>\n<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<dd> Collection and Use of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.<\/p>\n<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company.\nApple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nThey may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\nYou are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\nWhat personal information we collect\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.<\/li>\n<li>When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.\nApple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.<\/li>\n<li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHow we use your personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.\nIf you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.\nIf you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.<\/li>\n<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\nWe may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\nWhere we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.\nWe limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.<\/li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.\nFor example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.\nBecause this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<\/li>\n<li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSource of your personal information where they are not collected from you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.<\/li>\n<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.<\/p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.<\/p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.\nThese companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.<\/p>\nOthers\n<p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information.\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWith the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.<\/p>\n<p>When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances.\nFor example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.\nPlease take care when using these features.<\/p>\n<p>If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family—including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases—may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information.\nVisit Family Sharing for more information.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nThe Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling\n<p>Apple does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.<\/p>\nIntegrity and Retention of Personal Information\n<p>Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.\nWe will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries.\nWhen assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nYour Privacy Rights\n<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by signing in to your Apple ID account page.\nFor other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.\nWe may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier.\nOnline tools for the exercise of access, deactivation/restriction, correction, or deletion requests are available on a regional basis by signing in to privacy.apple.com.\nFor users with Shazam accounts sign in to www.shazam.com/privacy.\nWhen you make a request using these online tools, we will verify your identity and the legitimacy of your request.<\/p>\nCalifornia\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act provides California consumers with the right to obtain from Apple information about the personal information about you that we collect, use, and disclose.\nYou can exercise your rights through an authorized agent by providing relevant details to allow sign in to privacy.apple.com.\nIf you cannot access Apple’s online tools, you or your agent can make a request to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to exercise your privacy rights, you have the right to not to receive discriminatory treatment or a lesser degree of service from Apple.<\/p>\nNevada\n<p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.\nApple does not sell your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>See our page on understanding and controlling your personal information for more information on exercising your rights.\nWhere the online tool is not currently available for access requests in your region, a request may be made directly to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.<\/p>\nChildren &amp.\nEducation\n<p>We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services.\nChildren under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school.\nFor example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple’s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child’s Information.\nand the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child.\nIn addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed Apple IDs for students.\nThe Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple handles student information and supplements Apple’s Privacy Policy.\nLearn more about Family Sharing, the Managed Apple IDs and Restrictions for children’s accounts.\nIf we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.\nIf at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child’s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.<\/p>\nLocation-Based Services\n<p>To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees, such as maps data providers, may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device.\nWhere available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location.\nUnless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services.\nFor example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.<\/p>\n<p>Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the “Find My” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work.<\/p>\nThird‑Party Sites and Services\n<p>Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services.\nOur products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third‑party iPhone app.<\/p>\n<p>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices.\nWe encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.<\/p>\n<p>If you purchase a subscription in a third party app or within News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher which we use to provide reports to the developer or publisher that include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence.\nIf you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe.\nThis information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.<\/p>\nInternational Transfers\n<p>All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy.\nPersonal information, relating to Apple services, regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland, and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc.\nApple uses approved Model Contractual Clauses for the international transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\nApple, as a global company, has a number of legal entities in different jurisdictions which are responsible for the personal information which they collect and which is processed on their behalf by Apple Inc.\nFor example, point of sale information in our Retail entities outside the U.S.\nis controlled by our individual Retail entities in each country.\nApple, Online Store and iTunes related personal information may also be controlled by legal entities outside the U.S.\nas reflected in the terms of each service.\nImagery and associated data collected by Apple around the world to improve Apple Maps, and in support of our Look Around feature is transferred to Apple Inc in California.<\/p>\n<p>Apple abides by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules System.\nThe APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies.\nIf you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern regarding our APEC CBPR and/or PRP certifications please visit our third-party dispute resolution provider.<\/p>\nOur Companywide Commitment to Your&nbsp;Privacy\n<p>To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Apple employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.<\/p>\nPrivacy Questions\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about Apple’s Privacy Policy or data processing, you would like to contact our Data Protection Officer, or if you would like to make a complaint about a possible breach of local privacy laws, please contact us.\nYou can always contact us by phone at the relevant Apple Support number for your country or region.<\/p>\n<p>When a privacy question or question about personal information received in response to an access/download request is received we have a dedicated team which triages your contact to address your issue.\nWhere your issue may be more substantive in nature, we may request more information from you.\nAll such substantive contacts receive a response within seven (7), days wherever possible - providing a response on the issue raised, requesting additional information where necessary or indicating that a response will require additional time.\nYou may at any time refer your complaint to the relevant regulator in your jurisdiction if you are unsatisfied with a reply received from us.\nIf you ask us, we will endeavor to provide you with information about relevant complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Where your complaint indicates an improvement could be made in our handling of privacy issues we will take steps to make such an update at the next reasonable opportunity.\nIn the event that a privacy issue has resulted in a negative impact on you or another person we will take steps to address that with you or that other person.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may update its Privacy Policy from time to time.\nWhen we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.\nWe will also contact you via your contact information on file, for example by email, notification or some other equivalent method.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Apple Inc.\nOne Apple Park Way, Cupertino, California, USA, 95014<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/dd>\n<\/dl> ","created_at":"2018-07-17

APPS)<\/p>\n<p>LICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>App licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”).\nIf you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International Ltd., which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International Ltd., but the App is licensed by the App Provider.\nAn App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in providing the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider.\nAny App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”).\nThe App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement.\nCertain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.<\/p>\n<p>IN-APP PURCHASES<\/p>\n<p>Apps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”).\nIn-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once.\nYou must authenticate your account before making In-App Purchases – separate from any authentication to obtain other Content – by entering your password or using Touch ID or Face ID.\nYou will be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-authenticating unless you’ve asked us to require a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID or Face ID.\nYou can turn off the ability to make In-App Purchases by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/HT201304.<\/p>\n<p>APP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT<\/p>\n<p>Apple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law.\nApp Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.<\/p>\n<p>APP BUNDLES<\/p>\n<p>Some Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”).\nThe price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle.\nThe App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle.<\/p>\n<p>LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT<\/p>\n<p>Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you.\nYour

source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by

not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents.\nYou will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party.\nYou agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use.\nExternal Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location.\nTo the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws.\nLicensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.<\/p>\n<p>e.\nNO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.\nTO THE

COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nIn no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\nThe foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.<\/p>\n<p>g.\nYou may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensed Application was obtained.\nIn particular, but without limitation, the Licensed Application may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S.\nTreasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or

CERTAIN CONTENT ACQUIRED FROM THIRD PARTIES<\/p>\n<p>Some Content available in certain Services are acquired by You from the third-party provider of such Content (as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Content), not Apple.&nbsp.\nFor example, Apple Books Content is acquired from book publishers, not Apple.\nIn such case, Apple acts as an agent for the Content provider in providing the Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction between you and the Content provider.\nHowever, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd.\nis the merchant of record for the Content you acquire from certain Services (e.g., Apple Books), but such Content is licensed by the Content provider.&nbsp.\nThe Content provider reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating to such Content.\nThe Content provider is solely responsible for such Content, any warranties

of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHow we use your personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.\nIf you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.\nIf you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.<\/li>\n<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\nWe may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\nWhere we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.\nWe limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.<\/li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.\nFor example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send

customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSource of your personal information where they are not collected from you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.<\/li>\n<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.<\/p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.<\/p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.\nThese companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.<\/p>\nOthers\n<p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information.\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWith the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.<\/p>\n<p>When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances.\nFor example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.\nPlease take care when using these features.<\/p>\n<p>If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family—including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases—may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information.\nVisit Family Sharing for more information.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nThe Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling\n<p>Apple does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.<\/p>\nIntegrity and Retention of Personal Information\n<p>Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.\nWe will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries.\nWhen assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nYour Privacy Rights\n<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by signing in to your Apple ID account page.\nFor other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.\nWe may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier.\nOnline tools for the exercise of access, deactivation/restriction, correction, or deletion requests are available on a regional basis by signing in to privacy.apple.com.\nFor users with Shazam accounts sign in to www.shazam.com/privacy.\nWhen you make a request using these online tools, we will verify your identity and the legitimacy of your request.<\/p>\nCalifornia\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act provides California consumers with the right to obtain from Apple information about the personal information about you that we collect, use, and disclose.\nYou can exercise your rights through an authorized agent by providing relevant details to allow sign in to privacy.apple.com.\nIf you cannot access Apple’s online tools,

access requests in your region, a request may be made directly to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.<\/p>\nChildren &amp.\nEducation\n<p>We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services.\nChildren under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school.\nFor example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple’s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child’s Information.\nand the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child.\nIn addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed Apple IDs for students.\nThe Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple handles student information and supplements Apple’s Privacy Policy.\nLearn more about Family Sharing, the Managed Apple IDs and Restrictions for children’s accounts.\nIf we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.\nIf at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child’s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.<\/p>\nLocation-Based Services\n<p>To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees, such as maps data providers, may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device.\nWhere available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location.\nUnless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services.\nFor example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.<\/p>\n<p>Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the “Find My” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work.<\/p>\nThird‑Party Sites and Services\n<p>Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services.\nOur products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third‑party iPhone app.<\/p>\n<p>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices.\nWe encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.<\/p>\n<p>If you purchase a subscription in a third party app or within News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher which we use to provide reports to the developer or publisher that include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence.\nIf you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe.\nThis information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.<\/p>\nInternational Transfers\n<p>All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy.\nPersonal information, relating to Apple services, regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland, and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc.\nApple uses approved Model Contractual Clauses for the international transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\nApple, as a global company, has a number of legal entities in different jurisdictions which are responsible for the personal information which they collect and which is processed on their behalf by Apple Inc.\nFor example, point of sale information in our Retail entities outside the U.S.\nis controlled by our individual Retail entities in each country.\nApple, Online Store and iTunes related personal information may also be controlled by legal entities outside the U.S.\nas reflected in the terms of each service.\nImagery and associated data collected by Apple around the world to improve Apple Maps, and in support of our Look Around feature is transferred to Apple Inc in California.<\/p>\n<p>Apple abides by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules System.\nThe APEC CBPR system provides a

impact on you or another person we will take steps to address that with you or that other person.<\/p>\n<p>Apple may update its Privacy Policy from time to time.\nWhen we change the policy in a

own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school.\nFor example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple’s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child’s Information.\nand

anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.<\/li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and

customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a

contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple

Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese

laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your

review this information before enabling these features, in Settings related to those features and/or online at apple.com/legal/privacy.\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy

Research Apps Privacy Policy<br>\n<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<dd> Collection and Use of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.<\/p>\n<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company.\nApple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nThey may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\nYou are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\nWhat personal information we collect\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.<\/li>\n<li>When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.\nApple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.<\/li>\n<li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHow we use your personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.\nIf you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.\nIf you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.<\/li>\n<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\nWe may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\nWhere we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.\nWe limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.<\/li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.\nFor example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.\nBecause this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<\/li>\n<li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSource of your personal information where they are not collected from you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.<\/li>\n<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.<\/p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.<\/p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.\nThese companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.<\/p>\nOthers\n<p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information.\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWith the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.<\/p>\n<p>When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances.\nFor example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.\nPlease take care when using these features.<\/p>\n<p>If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family—including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases—may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information.\nVisit Family Sharing for more information.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nThe Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling\n<p>Apple does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.<\/p>\nIntegrity and Retention of Personal Information\n<p>Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.\nWe will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries.\nWhen assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nYour Privacy Rights\n<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by signing in to your Apple ID account page.\nFor other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.\nWe may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier.\nOnline tools for the exercise of access, deactivation/restriction, correction, or deletion requests are available on a regional basis by signing in to

important to Apple so we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, we provide data and privacy information imbedded in our products connected with our Data &amp.\nPrivacy Icon for certain features that ask to use your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>You can review this information before enabling these features, in Settings related to those features and/or online at apple.com/legal/privacy.\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and contact us if you have any questions.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nYour California Privacy Disclosures&nbsp;<br>\nInformation Regarding Commercial Electronic Messages in Canada<br>\nApple Health Research Apps Privacy Policy<br>\n<\/p>\n<dl>\n<dt>\n<\/dt>\n<dd> Collection and Use of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.<\/p>\n<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company.\nApple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nThey may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\nYou are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\nWhat personal information we collect\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.<\/li>\n<li>When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.\nApple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.<\/li>\n<li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nHow we use your personal&nbsp;information\n<p>We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject, for the performance of a contract to which you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.\nIf you have questions about this legal basis you can contact the Data Protection Officer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.\nIf you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime by updating your preferences.<\/li>\n<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.\nWe may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal content, including child sexual exploitation material.\nWhere we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.\nWe limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.\nFor certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.<\/li>\n<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.\nFor example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.<\/li>\n<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.\nBecause this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.<\/li>\n<li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications.<\/li>\n<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.<\/li>\n<li>If you apply for a position at Apple or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at Apple, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you.\nIf you are a candidate, you will receive more information about how Apple handles candidate personal information at the time of application.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nSource of your personal information where they are not collected from you\n<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.\nWe may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Apple, we may have received your personal information from third parties such as recruiters or external websites.\nWe will use the personal information we receive to contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy.\nIf you did not provide us your personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your candidacy.\nFor research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.\nWhen acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.\nWhen using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.<\/p>\nCollection and Use of Non-Personal Information\n<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.<\/li>\n<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nCookies and Other Technologies\n<p>Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \"cookies\" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.\nIf you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.\nIf you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.\nYou may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.\nIn third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.\nKnowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.\nAnd knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.\nOn your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.\nSecurity section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.\nFor other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nApple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.<\/p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.\nPixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nDisclosure to Third Parties\n<p>At times Apple may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Apple market to consumers.\nWhen we do, we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws.\nApple does not sell personal information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.\nFor example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service, including information about your device.\nIf you are approved for service, your account will be governed by Apple and your carrier’s respective privacy policies.<\/p>\nService Providers\n<p>Apple shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.\nThese companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Apple operates.<\/p>\nOthers\n<p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information.\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.\nWe may also disclose information about you, but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.&nbsp.\nThis could include providing information to public or governmental authorities.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nProtection of Personal&nbsp;Information\n<p>Apple takes the security of your personal information very seriously.\nApple online services such as the Apple Online Store and iTunes Store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by Apple, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.\nWith the exception of iCloud Mail, iCloud data is stored in encrypted form including when we utilize third-party storage.<\/p>\n<p>When you use some Apple products, services, or applications or post on an Apple forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances.\nFor example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.\nPlease take care when using these features.<\/p>\n<p>If you or anyone else using Family Sharing logs on to a device that is owned by a third party, any information shared within your Family—including calendar, location, photos, and iTunes purchases—may be downloaded on to that third-party device thereby disclosing any such shared information.\nVisit Family Sharing for more information.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nThe Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling\n<p>Apple does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.<\/p>\nIntegrity and Retention of Personal Information\n<p>Apple makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.\nWe will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our service specific privacy summaries.\nWhen assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\nYour Privacy Rights\n<p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by signing in to your Apple ID account page.\nFor other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Apple is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.<\/p>\n<p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.\nWe may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes as described earlier.\nOnline tools for the exercise of access, deactivation/restriction, correction, or deletion requests are available on a regional basis by signing in to privacy.apple.com.\nFor users with Shazam accounts sign in to www.shazam.com/privacy.\nWhen you make a request using these online tools, we will verify your identity and the legitimacy of your request.<\/p>\nCalifornia\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act provides California consumers with the right to obtain from Apple information about the personal information about you that we collect, use, and disclose.\nYou can exercise your rights through an authorized agent by providing relevant details to allow sign in to privacy.apple.com.\nIf you cannot access Apple’s online tools, you or your agent can make a request to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to exercise your privacy rights, you have the right to not to receive discriminatory treatment or a lesser degree of service from Apple.<\/p>\nNevada\n<p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.\nApple does not sell your personal information.<\/p>\n<p>See our page on understanding and controlling your personal information for more information on exercising your rights.\nWhere the online tool is not currently available for access requests in your region, a request may be made directly to apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.<\/p>\nChildren &amp.\nEducation\n<p>We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using Apple products and services.\nChildren under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to create their own Apple IDs, unless their parent provided verifiable consent or as part of the child account creation process in Family Sharing or they have obtained a Managed Apple ID account (where available) through their school.\nFor example, a parent must review the Apple ID and Family Sharing Disclosure and agree to the Consent to Apple’s Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Child’s Information.\nand the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, before they can begin the Apple ID account creation process for their child.\nIn addition, schools that participate in Apple School Manager and have reviewed and consented to the Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure may create Managed Apple IDs for students.\nThe Managed Apple IDs for Students Disclosure describes how Apple handles student information and supplements Apple’s Privacy Policy.\nLearn more about Family Sharing, the Managed Apple IDs and Restrictions for children’s accounts.\nIf we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, outside the above circumstances we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.\nIf at any time a parent needs to access, correct, or delete data associated with their Family Sharing account or child’s Apple ID, they may contact us through one of the options provided at the bottom of this page.<\/p>\nLocation-Based Services\n<p>To provide location-based services on Apple products, Apple and our partners and licensees, such as maps data providers, may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Apple computer or device.\nWhere available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location.\nUnless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services.\nFor example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.<\/p>\n<p>Some location-based services offered by Apple, such as the “Find My” feature, require your personal information for the feature to work.<\/p>\nThird‑Party Sites and Services\n<p>Apple websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services.\nOur products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third‑party iPhone app.<\/p>\n<p>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices.\nWe encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.<\/p>\n<p>If you purchase a subscription in a third party app or within News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher which we use to provide reports to the developer or publisher that include information about the subscription you purchased, and your country of residence.\nIf you cancel all of your subscriptions with a particular developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe.\nThis information is provided to developers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.<\/p>\nInternational Transfers\n<p>All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy.\nPersonal information, relating to Apple services, regarding individuals who reside in a member state of the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland is controlled by Apple Distribution International Limited in Ireland, and processed on its behalf by Apple Inc.\nApple uses approved Model Contractual Clauses for the international transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.\nApple, as a global company, has a number of legal entities in different jurisdictions which are responsible for the personal information which they collect and which is processed on their behalf by Apple Inc.\nFor example, point of sale information in our Retail entities outside the U.S.\nis controlled by our individual Retail entities in each country.\nApple, Online Store and iTunes related personal information may also be controlled by legal entities outside the U.S.\nas reflected in the terms of each service.\nImagery and associated data collected by Apple around the world to improve Apple Maps, and in support of our Look Around feature is transferred to Apple Inc in California.<\/p>\n<p>Apple abides by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules System.\nThe APEC CBPR system provides a
