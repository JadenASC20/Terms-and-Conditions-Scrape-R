2015<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>APPLICABILITY OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>This Dispute Resolution Policy (“Agreement”) is a part of the contracts between you and Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., and/or Activision Blizzard, Inc.\n(collectively, “Blizzard”), which governs the resolution of any dispute, controversy, or claim, whether based on contract, tort, fraudulent misrepresentation, statute, regulation, constitution, common law, equity, or any other matter that arises out of or relates to the North American Battle.net End User License Agreement (“Dispute”).\nBy agreeing to the North American Battle.net End User License Agreement, you hereby consent to this Agreement.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>DISPUTES.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute related to, or arising out of, the North American Battle.net End User License Agreement, which is incorporated into this policy, you and Blizzard agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except as set forth in Section 5 below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before either party initiates any arbitration or court proceeding.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Negotiations will begin upon receipt of written notice by the party raising the Dispute.\nBlizzard will send its notice to your billing address and e-mail you a copy to the e-mail address you have provided to us.<\/li>\n<li>You will send your notice to Blizzard at Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., 16215 Alton Parkway, Irvine, CA 92618, Attn.: General Counsel.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>BINDING ARBITRATION.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If a Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations, either you or Blizzard may elect to have the Dispute (except as set forth in Section 5 below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.\nAny election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.\nYou should review this provision carefully.\nThis arbitration provision limits your and Blizzard’s ability to litigate claims in court and you and Blizzard each agree to waive your respective rights to a jury trial.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, which are available at the JAMS website ( http://www.jamsadr.com/ ).\nThis arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) shall apply to the construction, interpretation, and enforceability of this Agreement notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in this Agreement.<\/li>\n<li>If, for any reason, JAMS is unable to provide the arbitration, you may file your Dispute with any national arbitration company under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.<\/li>\n<li>The arbitrator shall determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration.\nThe arbitrator has authority to decide all issues of arbitrability, including where a party raises as a defense to arbitration that the claims in question are subject to one or more Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration in Section 5, below.<\/li>\n<li>Where any action includes claims that are arbitrable and claims that are not, the entire action shall be stayed, absent a showing of prejudice to the complaining party, pending the completion of the arbitration of the arbitrable issues.\nYou or Blizzard can request the stay be lifted upon a showing of prejudice.<\/li>\n<li>Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures.<\/li>\n<li>The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.\nThe arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nThe arbitrator must follow applicable law.\nThe decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and Blizzard, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<\/li>\n<li>THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nThey further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation.\nHowever, the arbitrator shall shift such fees and costs to ensure that you do not pay significant forum fees.\nIn addition, you shall not be required to pay any type of fee or cost in arbitration that you would not have had to pay had you been free to file your claim in court.\nThe parties understand that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\nHowever, each side will be permitted discovery sufficient to allow that side a fair opportunity to present or defend their claims.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>CLASS AND COLLECTIVE ACTION WAIVER.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and Blizzard agree that any arbitration or court proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between Blizzard and you individually.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A CLAIM BY, OR ON BEHALF OF, OTHER PERSONS, WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED IN, JOINED WITH, OR CONSOLIDATED WITH, THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS OR ANY COURT PROCEEDINGS BETWEEN YOU AND BLIZZARD;<\/li>\n<li>THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED, ADJUDICATED, OR RESOLVED THROUGH COURT PROCEEDINGS ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES.\nAND<\/li>\n<li>YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR AS A MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS FOR ANY DISPUTE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION OR ANY DISPUTE BROUGHT IN COURT.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Any Dispute regarding the prohibitions in the prior sections shall be resolved by the arbitrator in accordance with this Agreement.\nIf, for any reason, this class or collective action waiver is deemed unenforceable by a court or arbitrator, you agree that the parties’ contract to arbitrate is then void, and any ongoing or future Dispute will be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Orange, State of California, United States of America, to the exclusion of arbitration.\nAny Dispute at that time in arbitration will be dismissed without prejudice and refiled in a court.\nUnder no circumstances do you or Blizzard agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or court proceedings or the joinder of claims in arbitration or court proceedings.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>EXCEPTIONS TO NEGOTIATIONS AND ARBITRATION.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and Blizzard agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of Blizzard’s intellectual property rights;<\/li>\n<li>any Dispute related to, or arising from, claims that the other party has committed piracy, or tortious interference.\nand<\/li>\n<li>any claim within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims courts.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>LOCATION OF ARBITRATION.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration will take place in your county of residence, to the exclusion of all other venues.\nFor residents outside the United States, any arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Los Angeles, State of California, United States of America.\nAny Dispute not subject to arbitration shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Orange, State of California, United States of America, and you and Blizzard agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>GOVERNING LAW.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Except as expressly provided otherwise, all Disputes shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles.<\/li>\n<li>The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>SEVERABILITY.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and Blizzard agree that if any portion of this Agreement is found illegal or unenforceable, such portion shall be severed and the remainder of this Agreement shall be given full force and effect.\nAny Dispute subject to any such portion of this Agreement shall be decided by the arbitrator.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>A court shall construe the agreement to arbitrate and the agreement to waive class or collective actions in any manner that will render them enforceable and give them effect.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>REJECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you desire to reject this Agreement, do not complete installation and return your product to its place of purchase for a full refund.\nCompletion of the installation process shall indicate your acceptance of this Agreement.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\nBack To DirectoryEnglish (US)DeutschEnglish (US)English (EU)English (SEA)Español (EU)Español

the privacy of its online visitors and does not apply to information that may be collected by Blizzard offline, including but not limited to employment related interactions.\nWhen you click a link to other sites from a Blizzard website, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those other sites.\nWe highly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any third party website you may be directed to before providing any personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>The personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed within the United States or other countries where Blizzard maintains facilities or business operations.<\/p>\n<p>By using this website and/or any of Blizzard’s online products or services, you acknowledge the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you object to anything described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites or play our games.\nThis Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.\nIf we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s Privacy Certified Program (“ESRB Privacy Certified”).\nESRB Privacy Certified is designed to ensure that our information collection, use and disclosure practices are

however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.<\/p>\n<p>Visitors purchasing products or services may have to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing

identification verification is complete or after 30 days if the case was not addressed within this period of time, unless otherwise required to establish, defend, or exercise our legal rights.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally identifiable information on Blizzard’s websites.\nHowever, we will obtain the customer’s consent to

announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made

partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain

Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing

confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer

Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions.\nThe Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources,

party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information

to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related

confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources,

party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our

upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions.\nThe Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources,

party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions.\nThe Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources,

party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard games feature \"Global Play,\" which allows you to play with other players outside of the region associated with the creation of your Blizzard account.\nThis feature is very beneficial to players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions.\nThe Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

Entertainment and its subsidiaries (collectively \"Blizzard\") respects the privacy of its players and online visitors.\nand recognizes the importance of providing a secure environment for them.\nWe have adopted a company-wide online Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) that explains how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us.\nThis Privacy Policy details how Blizzard safeguards the privacy of its online visitors and does not apply to information that may be collected by Blizzard offline, including but not limited to employment related interactions.\nWhen you click a link to other sites from a Blizzard website, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those other sites.\nWe highly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any third party website you may be directed to before providing any personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>The personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed within the United States or other countries where Blizzard maintains facilities or business operations.<\/p>\n<p>By using this website and/or any of Blizzard’s online products or services, you acknowledge the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you object to anything described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites or play our games.\nThis Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.\nIf we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s Privacy Certified Program (“ESRB Privacy Certified”).\nESRB Privacy Certified is designed to ensure that our information collection, use and disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.\nTo protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative, and all of our websites where this Privacy Policy is posted have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection, use and disclosure practices.<\/p>\n1.\nWhat personal information is collected and how do we use it?\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected from you.<\/strong> If an online visitor submits information to Blizzard, it will usually be through either: (1) the purchase of goods or services though our online platforms, (2) product or account registration, or registration for online game participation, (3) player match-up services, (4) message boards or forums, (5) eCards or recruit-a-friend e-mails, (6) warranty registrations, (7) contest registrations, (8) the playing of a game or use of a service, (9) surveys, (10) customer service or technical support, (11) Share Wish List feature, and/or (12) newsletters.\nPersonal information collected may include your name, home address, phone number, and/or e-mail address.\nWe do not require this information to gain access to our websites, however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.<\/p>\n<p>Visitors purchasing products or services may have to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.<\/p>\n<p>For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other personal and non-personal information including but not limited to your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform preferences.\nand, we may combine such information with other personal and/or non-personal information.<\/p>\n<p>In specific cases, we may ask you to provide a copy of a document or government-issued ID to verify your identity, location, and/or account ownership.\nWhen photo identification is provided to us, it is normally deleted as soon as the identification verification is complete or after 30 days if the case was not addressed within this period of time, unless otherwise required to establish, defend, or exercise our legal rights.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally identifiable information on Blizzard’s websites.\nHowever, we will obtain the customer’s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication in accordance with the applicable Blizzard agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be considered private.\nBlizzard may monitor and/or record your communications (including without limitation chat text) when you are using a product or service for toxicity analysis, to prevent cheating and fraud, or for enforcement of Blizzard’s End User License Agreement (EULA) and/or terms of use.\nYou hereby provide your irrevocable, express consent to such monitoring and recording.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or communications, including without limitation chat text or voice communications.\nBecause voice chat and other communications may be viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally identifiable information in those communications.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Collected Automatically.<\/strong> In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to Blizzard.\nBlizzard may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community.\nIn addition, Blizzard may use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or enforcement purposes.\nBlizzard may also collect IP information, which it may use to infer your approximate location.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected from third parties (our vendors, affiliates, and business partners).<\/strong> Blizzard may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a Blizzard website with data from third parties in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems.\nIf you register an account using your Facebook credentials, the following information may be collected: (1) your first and last name and other information made publicly available by you, (2) your friends list, and (3) the email address associated with your account.\nSimilar data exchanges will occur when you link your Blizzard account with other companies, such as Twitch and console platforms.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we use

to monitor for toxicity, and to enforce our agreements with you.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be considered private.\nBy using the speech to text feature in voice chat, you understand that your communications may be used for transcription of speech to text, including for accessibility purposes.\nWe do not retain the chat transcription after you end the session and close the chat window.\nHowever, by using voice or text chat, you understand that your communications may be monitored and/or recorded for accessibility, toxicity analysis (e.g.\ntoxic player behavior), to prevent cheating and fraud, or for enforcement of Blizzard’s End User License Agreement (EULA) and/or terms of use.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or communications, including without limitation chat text, voice communications, or speech to text for transcription purposes.\nBecause voice chat and other communications may be viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally identifiable information in those communications.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we may use your personal information for internal marketing or demographic purposes and so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs.\nWe do this

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer Protection Act\n<p>Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California law gives its residents the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from

type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information

to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise

confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard games feature \"Global Play,\" which allows you to play with other players outside of the region associated with the creation of your Blizzard account.\nThis feature is very beneficial to players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions.\nThe Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

have adopted a company-wide online Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) that explains how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us.\nThis Privacy Policy details how Blizzard safeguards the privacy of its online visitors and does not apply to information that may be collected by Blizzard offline, including but not limited to employment related interactions.\nWhen you click a link to other sites from a Blizzard website, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those other sites.\nWe highly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any third party website you may be directed to before providing any personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>The personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed within the United States or other countries where Blizzard maintains facilities or business operations.<\/p>\n<p>By using this website and/or any of Blizzard’s online products or services, you acknowledge the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you object to anything described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites or play our games.\nThis Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.\nIf we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s Privacy Certified Program (“ESRB Privacy Certified”).\nESRB Privacy Certified is designed to ensure that our information collection, use and disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.\nTo protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative, and all of our websites where this Privacy Policy is posted have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection, use and disclosure practices.<\/p>\n1.\nWhat personal information is collected and how do we use it?\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected from you.<\/strong> If an online visitor submits information to Blizzard, it will usually be through either: (1) the purchase of goods or services though our

and/or (12) newsletters.\nPersonal information collected may include your name, home address, phone number, and/or e-mail address.\nWe do not require this information to gain access to our websites, however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.<\/p>\n<p>Visitors purchasing products or services may have to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.<\/p>\n<p>For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other personal and non-personal information including but not limited to your age, date of

identification verification is complete or after 30 days if the case was not addressed within this period of time, unless otherwise required to establish, defend, or exercise our legal rights.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally identifiable information on Blizzard’s websites.\nHowever, we will obtain the customer’s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication in accordance with the applicable Blizzard agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be considered

feature in voice chat, you understand that your communications may be used for transcription of speech to text, including for accessibility purposes.\nWe do not retain the chat transcription after you

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer Protection Act\n<p>Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California law gives its residents the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from

type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our

upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise

confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions.\nThe Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources,

party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

the following link useful: http://www.allaboutdnt.com/ .<\/p>\n7.\nPrivacy Information for Nevada Residents\n<p>Under Nevada law, Nevada residents who have purchased goods or services from us may opt

players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions.\nThe Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions.\nThe Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our

upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related

rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

2015<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>APPLICABILITY OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>This Dispute Resolution Policy (“Agreement”) is a part of the contracts between you and Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., and/or Activision Blizzard, Inc.\n(collectively, “Blizzard”), which governs the resolution of any dispute, controversy, or claim, whether based on contract, tort, fraudulent misrepresentation, statute, regulation, constitution, common law, equity, or any other matter that arises out of or relates to the North American Battle.net End User License Agreement (“Dispute”).\nBy agreeing to the North American Battle.net End User License Agreement, you hereby consent to this Agreement.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>DISPUTES.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute related to, or arising out of, the North American Battle.net End User License Agreement, which is incorporated into this policy, you and Blizzard agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except as set forth in Section 5 below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before either party initiates any arbitration or court proceeding.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Negotiations will begin upon receipt of written notice by the party raising the Dispute.\nBlizzard will send its notice to your billing address and e-mail you a copy to the e-mail address you have provided to us.<\/li>\n<li>You will send your notice to Blizzard at Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., 16215 Alton Parkway, Irvine, CA 92618, Attn.: General Counsel.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>BINDING ARBITRATION.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If a Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations, either you or Blizzard may elect to have the Dispute (except as set forth in Section 5 below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.\nAny election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.\nYou should review this provision carefully.\nThis arbitration provision limits your and Blizzard’s ability to litigate claims in court and you and Blizzard each agree to waive your respective rights to a jury trial.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, which are available at the JAMS website ( http://www.jamsadr.com/ ).\nThis arbitration provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) shall apply to the construction, interpretation, and enforceability of this Agreement notwithstanding any other choice of law provision contained in this Agreement.<\/li>\n<li>If, for any reason, JAMS is unable to provide the arbitration, you may file your Dispute with any national arbitration company under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.<\/li>\n<li>The arbitrator shall determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration.\nThe arbitrator has authority to decide all issues of arbitrability, including where a party raises as a defense to arbitration that the claims in question are subject to one or more Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration in Section 5, below.<\/li>\n<li>Where any action includes claims that are arbitrable and claims that are not, the entire action shall be stayed, absent a showing of prejudice to the complaining party, pending the completion of the arbitration of the arbitrable issues.\nYou or Blizzard can request the stay be lifted upon a showing of prejudice.<\/li>\n<li>Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures.<\/li>\n<li>The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.\nThe arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nThe arbitrator must follow applicable law.\nThe decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and Blizzard, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<\/li>\n<li>THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nThey further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation.\nHowever, the arbitrator shall shift such fees and costs to ensure that you do not pay significant forum fees.\nIn addition, you shall not be required to pay any type of fee or cost in arbitration that you would not have had to pay had you been free to file your claim in court.\nThe parties understand that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\nHowever, each side will be permitted discovery sufficient to allow that side a fair opportunity to present or defend their claims.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>CLASS AND COLLECTIVE ACTION WAIVER.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and Blizzard agree that any arbitration or court proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between Blizzard and you individually.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A CLAIM BY, OR ON BEHALF OF, OTHER PERSONS, WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED IN, JOINED WITH, OR CONSOLIDATED WITH, THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS OR ANY COURT PROCEEDINGS BETWEEN YOU AND BLIZZARD;<\/li>\n<li>THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED, ADJUDICATED, OR RESOLVED THROUGH COURT PROCEEDINGS ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES.\nAND<\/li>\n<li>YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR AS A MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS FOR ANY DISPUTE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION OR ANY DISPUTE BROUGHT IN COURT.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Any Dispute regarding the prohibitions in the prior sections shall be resolved by the arbitrator in accordance with this Agreement.\nIf, for any reason, this class or collective action waiver is deemed unenforceable by a court or arbitrator, you agree that the parties’ contract to arbitrate is then void, and any ongoing or future Dispute will be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Orange, State of California, United States of America, to the exclusion of arbitration.\nAny Dispute at that time in arbitration will be dismissed without prejudice and refiled in a court.\nUnder no circumstances do you or Blizzard agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or court proceedings or the joinder of claims in arbitration or court proceedings.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>EXCEPTIONS TO NEGOTIATIONS AND ARBITRATION.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and Blizzard agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of Blizzard’s intellectual property rights;<\/li>\n<li>any Dispute related to, or arising from, claims that the other party has committed piracy, or tortious interference.\nand<\/li>\n<li>any claim within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims courts.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>LOCATION OF ARBITRATION.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration will take place in your county of residence, to the exclusion of all other venues.\nFor residents outside the United States, any arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Los Angeles, State of California, United States of America.\nAny Dispute not subject to arbitration shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Orange, State of California, United States of America, and you and Blizzard agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>GOVERNING LAW.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Except as expressly provided otherwise, all Disputes shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles.<\/li>\n<li>The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>SEVERABILITY.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and Blizzard agree that if any portion of this Agreement is found illegal or unenforceable, such portion shall be severed and the remainder of this Agreement shall be given full force and effect.\nAny Dispute subject to any such portion of this Agreement shall be decided by the arbitrator.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>A court shall construe the agreement to arbitrate and the agreement to waive class or collective actions in any manner that will render them enforceable and give them effect.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>REJECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>If you desire to reject this Agreement, do not complete installation and return your product to its place of purchase for a full refund.\nCompletion of the installation

providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

their personal information, as defined by the CCPA.\nThis does not include when:<\/p>\n<p>•\tYou direct us to disclose your personal information or use us to interact with a third party and the third party does not sell the personal information;<br>\n•\tWe use or share an identifier solely to alert a third party you have opted out of the sale of your personal information;<br>\n•\tYour personal

if it materially changes how the information is used or shared.\nand<br>\n•\tWe use or share your personal information under a written contract with a service provider necessary to perform a business purpose.\nHere, the service the service provider performs is on our behalf, and our written contract prohibits it from keeping, using or disclosing your personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose identified in the contract.<\/p>\n<p>In these cases, the disclosure of your personal information would not be considered a “sale” under CCPA.\nWe use and share your

currently have no plans to do so in the future.\nHowever, we have provided you with a system to record your preference that your data not be sold in the future.\nYou may make this request by clicking

players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions.\nThe Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

fraudulent misrepresentation, statute, regulation, constitution, common law, equity, or any other matter that arises out of or relates to the North American Battle.net End User License Agreement (“Dispute”).\nBy agreeing to the North American Battle.net End User License Agreement, you hereby consent to this Agreement.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>DISPUTES.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute related to, or arising out of, the North American Battle.net End User License Agreement, which is incorporated into this policy, you

State of California, United States of America, to the exclusion of arbitration.\nAny Dispute at that time in arbitration will be dismissed without prejudice and refiled in a court.\nUnder no circumstances do you or Blizzard agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or court proceedings or the joinder of claims in arbitration or court proceedings.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>EXCEPTIONS TO NEGOTIATIONS AND ARBITRATION.<\/strong>\n<\/p>\n<p>You and Blizzard agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above

the privacy of its online visitors and does not apply to information that may be collected by Blizzard offline, including but not limited to employment related interactions.\nWhen you click a link to other sites from a Blizzard website, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those other sites.\nWe highly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any third party website you may be directed to before providing any personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>The personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed within the United States or other countries where Blizzard maintains facilities or business operations.<\/p>\n<p>By using this website and/or any of Blizzard’s online products or services, you acknowledge the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you object to anything described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites or play our games.\nThis Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.\nIf we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s Privacy Certified Program (“ESRB Privacy Certified”).\nESRB Privacy Certified is designed to ensure that our information collection, use and disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.\nTo protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative, and all of our websites where this Privacy Policy is posted have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection, use and disclosure practices.<\/p>\n1.\nWhat personal information is collected and how do we use

however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.<\/p>\n<p>Visitors purchasing products or services may have to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing

rights.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally identifiable information on Blizzard’s websites.\nHowever, we will obtain the customer’s consent to

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer Protection Act\n<p>Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California law gives its residents the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from

type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our

to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related

rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard games feature \"Global Play,\" which allows you to play with other players outside of the region associated with the creation of your Blizzard account.\nThis feature is very beneficial to players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions.\nThe Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy Policy difficult, we want to help you through alternative means.\nPlease contact us, and let us know how we may best help you, at DataPrivacy@blizzard.com or 877-566-3886 or Blizzard Entertainment,

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to

confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

Entertainment and its subsidiaries (collectively \"Blizzard\") respects the privacy of its players and online visitors.\nand recognizes the importance of providing a secure environment for them.\nWe have adopted a company-wide online Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) that explains how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us.\nThis Privacy Policy details how Blizzard safeguards the privacy of its online visitors and does not apply to information that may be collected by Blizzard offline, including but not limited to employment related interactions.\nWhen you click a link to other sites from a Blizzard website, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those other sites.\nWe highly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any third party website you may be directed to before providing any personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>The personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed within the United States or other countries where Blizzard maintains facilities or business operations.<\/p>\n<p>By using this website and/or any of Blizzard’s online products or services, you acknowledge the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you object to anything described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites or play our games.\nThis Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.\nIf we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s Privacy Certified Program (“ESRB Privacy Certified”).\nESRB Privacy Certified is designed to ensure that our information collection, use and disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.\nTo protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative, and all of our websites where this Privacy Policy is posted have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection, use and disclosure practices.<\/p>\n1.\nWhat personal information is collected and how do we use it?\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected from you.<\/strong> If an online visitor submits information to Blizzard, it will usually be through either: (1) the purchase of goods or services though our

and/or (12) newsletters.\nPersonal information collected may include your name, home address, phone number, and/or e-mail address.\nWe do not require this information to gain access to our websites, however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.<\/p>\n<p>Visitors purchasing products or services may have to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.<\/p>\n<p>For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other personal and non-personal information including but not limited to your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform preferences.\nand, we may combine such information with other personal and/or non-personal information.<\/p>\n<p>In specific cases, we may ask you to provide a copy of a document or government-issued ID to verify your identity, location, and/or account ownership.\nWhen photo identification is provided to us, it is normally deleted as soon as the identification verification is complete or after 30 days if the case was not addressed within this period of time, unless otherwise required to establish, defend, or exercise our legal rights.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally identifiable information on Blizzard’s websites.\nHowever, we will obtain the customer’s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication in accordance with the applicable Blizzard agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be considered private.\nBlizzard may monitor and/or record your communications (including without limitation chat text) when you are using a product or service for toxicity analysis, to prevent cheating and fraud, or for enforcement of Blizzard’s End User License Agreement (EULA) and/or terms of use.\nYou hereby provide your irrevocable, express consent to such monitoring and recording.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or communications, including without limitation chat text or voice communications.\nBecause voice chat and other communications may be viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally identifiable information in those communications.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Collected Automatically.<\/strong> In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to Blizzard.\nBlizzard may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community.\nIn addition, Blizzard may use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or enforcement purposes.\nBlizzard may also collect IP information, which it may use to infer your approximate location.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected from third parties (our vendors, affiliates, and business partners).<\/strong> Blizzard may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a Blizzard website with data from third parties in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems.\nIf you register an account using your Facebook credentials, the following information may be collected: (1) your first and last name and other information made publicly available by you, (2) your friends list, and (3) the email address associated with your account.\nSimilar data exchanges will occur when you link your Blizzard account with other companies, such as Twitch and console platforms.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we use

to monitor for toxicity, and to enforce our agreements with you.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be considered private.\nBy using the speech to text feature in voice chat, you understand that your communications may be used for transcription of speech to text, including for accessibility purposes.\nWe do not retain the chat transcription after you end the session and close the chat window.\nHowever, by using voice or text chat, you understand that your communications may be monitored and/or recorded for accessibility, toxicity analysis (e.g.\ntoxic player behavior), to prevent cheating and fraud, or for enforcement of Blizzard’s End User License Agreement (EULA) and/or terms of use.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or communications, including without limitation chat text, voice communications, or speech to text for transcription purposes.\nBecause voice chat and other communications may be viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally identifiable information in those communications.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we may use your personal information for internal marketing or demographic purposes and so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs.\nWe do this

or assets<\/p>\n2.\nWhat type of communications may you receive?\nOffers\n<p>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions.\nOut of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer Protection Act\n<p>Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California law gives its residents the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information (if we sell such information), subject to certain restrictions.\nFor security purposes, we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you -- when you request to exercise your California privacy rights.\nYou also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on

type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise

rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources,

party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

have adopted a company-wide online Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) that explains how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us.\nThis Privacy Policy details how Blizzard safeguards the privacy of its online visitors and does not apply to information that may be collected by Blizzard offline, including but not limited to employment related interactions.\nWhen you click a link to other sites from a Blizzard website, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those other sites.\nWe highly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any third party website you may be directed to before providing any personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>The personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed within the United States or other countries where Blizzard maintains facilities or business operations.<\/p>\n<p>By using this website and/or any of Blizzard’s online products or services, you acknowledge the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you object to anything described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites or play our games.\nThis Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.\nIf we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s Privacy Certified Program (“ESRB Privacy Certified”).\nESRB Privacy Certified is designed to ensure that our information collection, use and disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.\nTo protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative, and all of our websites where this Privacy Policy is posted have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection, use and disclosure practices.<\/p>\n1.\nWhat personal information is collected and how do we use it?\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected from you.<\/strong> If an online visitor submits information to Blizzard, it will usually be through either: (1) the purchase of goods or services though our

however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.<\/p>\n<p>Visitors purchasing products or services may have to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.<\/p>\n<p>For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other personal and non-personal information including but not limited to your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform preferences.\nand, we may combine such information with other personal and/or non-personal information.<\/p>\n<p>In specific cases, we may ask you to provide a

identification verification is complete or after 30 days if the case was not addressed within this period of time, unless otherwise required to establish, defend, or exercise our legal rights.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally identifiable information on Blizzard’s websites.\nHowever, we will obtain the customer’s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication in accordance with the applicable Blizzard agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be considered private.\nBlizzard may monitor and/or record your communications (including without limitation chat text) when you are using a product or service for toxicity analysis, to prevent cheating and fraud,

agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or communications, including without limitation chat text or voice communications.\nBecause voice chat and other communications may be viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally identifiable information in those communications.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Collected Automatically.<\/strong> In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to Blizzard.\nBlizzard may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community.\nIn addition, Blizzard may use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or enforcement purposes.\nBlizzard may also collect IP information, which it may use to infer your approximate location.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected from third parties (our vendors, affiliates, and business partners).<\/strong> Blizzard may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a Blizzard website with data from third parties in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems.\nIf you register an account using your Facebook credentials, the following information may be collected: (1) your first and last name and other information made publicly available by you, (2) your friends list, and (3) the email address associated with your account.\nSimilar data exchanges will occur when you link your Blizzard account with other companies, such as Twitch and console platforms.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we use

feature in voice chat, you understand that your communications may be used for transcription of speech to text, including for accessibility purposes.\nWe do not retain the chat transcription after you

expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or communications, including without limitation chat text, voice communications, or speech to text for transcription purposes.\nBecause voice chat and other communications may be viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally identifiable information in those communications.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we may use your personal information for internal marketing or demographic purposes and so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs.\nWe do this

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

their personal information, as defined by the CCPA.\nThis does not include when:<\/p>\n<p>•\tYou direct us to disclose your personal information or use us to interact with a third party and the third

if it materially changes how the information is used or shared.\nand<br>\n•\tWe use or share your personal information under a written contract with a service provider necessary to perform a business purpose.\nHere, the service the service provider performs is on our behalf, and our written contract prohibits it from keeping, using or disclosing your personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose identified in the contract.<\/p>\n<p>In these cases, the disclosure of your personal information would not be considered a “sale” under CCPA.\nWe use and share your

type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our

upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise

rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources,

party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing

confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

the privacy of its online visitors and does not apply to information that may be collected by Blizzard offline, including but not limited to employment related interactions.\nWhen you click a link to other sites from a Blizzard website, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those other sites.\nWe highly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any third party website you may be directed to before providing any personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>The personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed within the United States or other countries where Blizzard maintains facilities or business operations.<\/p>\n<p>By using this website and/or any of Blizzard’s online products or services, you acknowledge the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you object to anything described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites or play our games.\nThis Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.\nIf we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s Privacy Certified Program (“ESRB Privacy Certified”).\nESRB Privacy Certified is designed to ensure that our information collection, use and disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.\nTo protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative, and all of our websites where this Privacy Policy is posted have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection, use and disclosure practices.<\/p>\n1.\nWhat personal information is collected and how do we use

however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.<\/p>\n<p>Visitors purchasing products or services may have to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.<\/p>\n<p>For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other personal and non-personal information including but not limited to your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform preferences.\nand, we may combine such information with other personal and/or non-personal information.<\/p>\n<p>In specific cases, we may ask you to provide a

identification verification is complete or after 30 days if the case was not addressed within this period of time, unless otherwise required to establish, defend, or exercise our legal rights.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally identifiable information on Blizzard’s websites.\nHowever, we will obtain the customer’s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication in accordance with the applicable Blizzard agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be considered private.\nBlizzard may monitor and/or record your communications (including without limitation chat text) when you are using a product or service for toxicity analysis, to prevent cheating and fraud,

agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or communications, including without limitation chat text or voice communications.\nBecause voice chat and other communications may be viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally identifiable information in those communications.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Collected Automatically.<\/strong> In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to Blizzard.\nBlizzard may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community.\nIn addition, Blizzard may use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or enforcement purposes.\nBlizzard may also collect IP information, which it may use to infer your approximate location.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected from third parties (our vendors, affiliates, and business partners).<\/strong> Blizzard may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a Blizzard website with data from third parties in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems.\nIf you register an account using your Facebook credentials, the following information may be collected: (1) your first and last name and other information made publicly available by you, (2) your friends list, and (3) the email address associated with your account.\nSimilar data exchanges will occur when you link your Blizzard account with other companies, such as Twitch and console platforms.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we use

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise

rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you

address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out of collection directly with those third parties.\nBefore disclosing Information to third parties, we recommend you check their respective privacy policies for further details.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Blizzard Using Your Information\n<p>You can exercise choices over how Blizzard uses your personal information and update your preferences at any time:<\/p>\n<p>•\tto remove yourself from receiving targeted email marketing or newsletters from Blizzard, simply click the unsubscribe link in the email or access your Battle.net account and edit your email communication preferences.\nYou will need your password to access your account;<\/p>\n<p>•\tto disable selected Cookies from collecting information relating to the effectiveness of advertising campaigns or analytics data and from serving you with personalized advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.\nand<\/p>\n<p>•\tTo remove having your game-data available to our community of application developers, opt-out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving email marketing communications from us, please note we may still contact you occasionally about the status of your account, such as to inform you that your account may be expiring, or for other service related information.<\/p>\n6.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\nCalifornia Consumer

players who travel frequently or have friends and family in other regions.\nThe Global Play feature requires that some or all of the personal information that you provided when you created your Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

have adopted a company-wide online Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) that explains how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us.\nThis Privacy Policy details how Blizzard safeguards the privacy of its online visitors and does not apply to information that may be collected by Blizzard offline, including but not limited to employment related interactions.\nWhen you click a link to other sites from a Blizzard website, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those other sites.\nWe highly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any third party website you may be directed to before providing any personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>The personal information you provide may be transferred to, stored, and processed within the United States or other countries where Blizzard maintains facilities or business operations.<\/p>\n<p>By using this website and/or any of Blizzard’s online products or services, you acknowledge the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you object to anything described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites or play our games.\nThis Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes.\nIf we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change before the change becoming effective.\nYour continued use of the Blizzard websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.<\/p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals on our websites confirm that Blizzard is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s Privacy Certified Program (“ESRB Privacy Certified”).\nESRB Privacy Certified is designed to ensure that our information collection, use and disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.\nTo protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative, and all of our websites where this Privacy Policy is posted have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection, use and disclosure practices.<\/p>\n1.\nWhat personal information is collected and how do we use it?\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected from you.<\/strong> If an online visitor submits information to Blizzard, it will usually be through either: (1) the purchase of goods or services though our

however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.<\/p>\n<p>Visitors purchasing products or services may have to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.<\/p>\n<p>For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other personal and non-personal information including but not limited to your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform preferences.\nand, we may combine such information with other personal and/or non-personal information.<\/p>\n<p>In specific cases, we may ask you to provide a copy of a document or government-issued ID to verify your identity, location, and/or account ownership.\nWhen photo identification is provided to us, it is normally deleted as soon as the identification verification is complete or after 30 days if the case was not addressed within this period of time, unless otherwise required to establish, defend, or exercise our legal rights.<\/p>\n<p>From time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally identifiable information on Blizzard’s websites.\nHowever, we will obtain the customer’s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication in accordance with the applicable Blizzard agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, communications made using a product or service should not be considered private.\nBlizzard may monitor and/or record your communications (including without limitation chat text) when you are using a product or service for toxicity analysis, to prevent cheating and fraud, or for enforcement of Blizzard’s End User License Agreement (EULA) and/or terms of use.\nYou hereby provide your irrevocable, express consent to such monitoring and recording.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of any user generated content or communications, including without limitation chat text or voice communications.\nBecause voice chat and other communications may be viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally identifiable information in those communications.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Collected Automatically.<\/strong> In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to Blizzard.\nBlizzard may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community.\nIn addition, Blizzard may use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or enforcement purposes.\nBlizzard may also collect IP information, which it may use to infer your approximate location.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected from third parties (our vendors, affiliates, and business partners).<\/strong> Blizzard may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a Blizzard website with data from third parties in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems.\nIf you register an account using your Facebook credentials, the following information may be collected: (1) your first and last name and other information made publicly available by you, (2) your friends list, and (3) the email address associated with your account.\nSimilar data exchanges will occur when you link your Blizzard account with other companies, such as Twitch and console platforms.<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we use

feature in voice chat, you understand that your communications may be used for transcription of speech to text, including for accessibility purposes.\nWe do not retain the chat transcription after you end the session and close the chat window.\nHowever, by using voice or text chat, you understand that your communications may be monitored and/or recorded for accessibility, toxicity analysis (e.g.\ntoxic player behavior), to prevent cheating and fraud, or for enforcement of Blizzard’s End User License Agreement (EULA) and/or terms of use.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you have no

purposes.\nBecause voice chat and other communications may be viewed and/or heard by other users, users should avoid revealing any personally identifiable information in those communications.<\/p>\n<p>Last, we may use your personal information for internal marketing or demographic purposes and so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs.\nWe do this to better understand and serve our customers.<\/p>\n<p>Personal information submitted by individuals acting solely in a business capacity is not subject to the uses set forth above or to any other

privacy, we present the option not to receive these communications.\nPlease see the “Choice” section below.<\/p>\nService-related Announcements\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.\nYou will also receive communication regarding your account security, such as reminders to reset your password and alerts related to changes and suspicious login activity on your account.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.<\/p>\nGame-related Announcements\n<p>We may send you information related to the game(s) you play.\nFor instance, we may congratulate you on your recent success.<\/p>\nCustomer Service\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.\nWe will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.<\/p>\nRecruit a Friend/E-cards/Share Wish List\n<p>If you choose to use our recruit-a-friend, Share Wish List, or e-card features, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the website.\nBlizzard does not store this information and uses it solely to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.<\/p>\n3.\nWho is collecting your information?\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a Blizzard website or in a Blizzard game or service, you are providing that information to Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries unless specifically stated otherwise in that location or in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally, Blizzard may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, etc.).\nIn these instances, Blizzard controls the use of your data via written contracts which conform to this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided with partner companies.\nFor instance, if you purchase something from Blizzard and ask that it be sent to you via FedEx, your information will be collected by FedEx.\nIf you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that service or by not providing any information.\nPlease be aware that we cannot control all of the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Blizzard, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will sufficiently protect personal information.<\/p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.\nThese features may collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.<\/p>\n4.\nWith whom may your personal information be shared?\n<p>Blizzard will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n<p>We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties.\nAdditionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties to tailor content and to adjust and improve our services.<\/p>\n<p>We may share your personal information with our affiliated companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you purchase a product or license a game from another company on our Battle.net platform, we may share some of your account information with that company so they may establish a direct relationship with you.\nBecause of that sharing, you may receive communications from that company.<\/p>\n<p>We share some of our players’ game data with our community of developers who create applications and websites that benefit our player community.\nYou may opt-out of having your game data included in this program by opting out of game-data sharing in the Privacy section of Battle.net account management.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your Information if we are required to do so by law.\nWe may also disclose your information to law enforcement or in civil litigation in connection with the enforcement of our rights or your legal obligations (e.g., bringing legal action against you if you are violating the EULA).<\/p>\n<p>We may share your information with vendors Blizzard engages to perform services for Blizzard (for example, platform providers, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, information technology hardware and software).\nIn these situations, a written contract between Blizzard and the vendor shall control such disclosure, the vendor must agree to reasonable levels of security regarding your data and the vendor will not be permitted to use your data except as required for the performance of those services for Blizzard.\nIf your data is anonymized, the vendor may use it for other purposes.<\/p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Blizzard and will become part of our normal business records.\nAs such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.\nSimilarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Blizzard's successor or assign.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another.\nWhen posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, the information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk.\nFor certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).\nIf your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at dataprivacy@blizzard.com to request removal.\nSometimes, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we cannot do so and why.<\/p>\n5.\nWhat choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?\n<p>You have choices over the Information provided by you and by other sources, and how Blizzard uses that Information.\nYou can exercise your choices by updating your preferences at any time and also by managing your settings in your Battle.net account, on your devices and third party accounts.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by You\n<p>If you do not want to provide Blizzard with personal information, then you can choose not to provide it.\nIf you choose not to provide us with personal information, we may not always be able to provide you with the Blizzard product or service you want.\nFor example, without providing an email address, you cannot create a Battle.net account.<\/p>\nYour Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties\n<p>You may control how third parties collect and share your Information by changing your preferences or opting out

Blizzard account be transferred to servers operated by Blizzard in other regions.<\/p>\n11.\nWhat are tracking technologies and how are they used?\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nWe may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.\nWe do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers (listed here), may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.\nThese technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.<\/p>\n<p>We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g.\nlanguage preference), and for authentication.\nUsers can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use features or areas of our websites may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nThese types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information.<\/p>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, lease click here.<\/p>\n<p>We partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nSome of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads.\nIf you wish to not have your information used to serve you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the DAA’s Consumer Choice page and/or the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads.\nPlease also note that we strive to adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.<\/p>\n12.\nWhat are Internet Protocol addresses?\n<p>An Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\").\nBlizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.\nSee the tracking technology discussion above.<\/p>\n13.\nWhat do you do to obtain a report about the personal information Blizzard holds about you or delete your personal information?\n<p>You may submit, free of charge, but no more than twice in a 12-month period, a verifiable request for the personal information we have about you.\nTo obtain the report, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>You may also submit a verifiable request for us to delete either: (1) your marketing information.\nor (2) your Battle.net account and your marketing information.\n<strong>The deletion of a Battle.net account is permanent and cannot be reversed.\nalso, all games, assets and history will also be permanently deleted.<\/strong> We may retain personal information to: (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.\nTo submit a request for deletion, click here to access our online webform.<\/p>\n<p>Note: California residents may have additional rights.\nplease see Section 6.<\/p>\n14.\nHow secure is your personal information?\n<p>Blizzard takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, forum posts and scores, etc.).\nWe also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration.\nIn addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.\nThe complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>It is very important for you to understand that you control the security of your account to a great extent.\nChoosing a password you don’t use on any other system is important.\nChanging that password occasionally is also a good idea.\nAnother way to substantially increase your account security is to add a free Blizzard authenticator app to your phone.\njust go to the app store for your phone and download it at no cost to you.<\/p>\n15.\nHelp for People with Disabilities:\n<p>If you have a disability that makes exercising any of your rights in this Privacy

money.\nTHE FOREGOING IS YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties so the
