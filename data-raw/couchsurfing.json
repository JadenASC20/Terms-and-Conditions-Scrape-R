use of such features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing

content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nPlease note that we may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in a hashed, non-human readable form, with these third parties.\nFor example, we may engage a third party data provider who may collect web log data from you or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content.\nThese cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to information you voluntarily provide to us (e.g., an email address) in a hashed, non-human readable form.\nFor more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the Community Guidelines.\nIn addition, you agree not to:<\/p>\n<p>(a) use the Services in violation of any applicable law or regulation, including promoting or encouraging any illegal activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other members from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

relating to the processing of your Contribution Method.\nCheck with your Contribution Method service provider for details.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Updating your Contribution Methods.<\/strong> You can

MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Services, except that you and Couchsurfing are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.\nSUBJECT TO ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\nYou and Couchsurfing also agree that the state or federal courts in San Francisco

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

technology;<\/p>\n<p>(j) may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party.\nBy posting Member Content, you represent and warrant that you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other members from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the

of our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(f) collect or store any information about any other member other than as permitted on our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(g) use our Services for any commercial purpose whatsoever, unless with prior written consent from Couchsurfing;<\/p>\n<p>(h) register for more than one member account;<\/p>\n<p>(i) impersonate any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member

third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or

content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms

94104-5401 US<\/p>\n<p>or by email at support@couchsurfing.com<\/p> 1.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT <p>You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services.\nBy registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely

third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or

content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and

(30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\nYou and Couchsurfing also agree that the state or federal courts in San Francisco

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion.\nIf Couchsurfing makes

and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how Couchsurfing collects, uses and discloses information about our

94104-5401 US<\/p>\n<p>or by email at support@couchsurfing.com<\/p> 1.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT <p>You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services.\nBy registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site.\nIf you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or

content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

DOLLARS ($100).<\/p>\n<p>17.4.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.\nACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF SECTIONS 16 AND 17 MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<\/p>\n<p>17.5 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS EXCLUDES OR LIMITS OUR LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY OUR NEGLIGENCE OR FOR FRAUD.<\/p> 18.\nINDEMNITY\n<p>You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Couchsurfing (and each of our officers, directors, members,

our Services.\n(b) any Member Content or Submissions you provide.\n(c) your violation of these Terms.\n(d) your violation of any rights of another.\nor (e) your conduct in connection with the Services.\nFurther, if you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that such entity agrees to indemnify you and Couchsurfing for violations of these Terms in

and we are not obligated to take any action.<\/p> 20.\nDISPUTES.\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH COUCHSURFING AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Services, except that you and Couchsurfing are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.\nSUBJECT TO ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\nYou and Couchsurfing also agree that the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.\nOther than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nWHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND COUCHSURFING WILL

matter.<\/p>\n<p>21.3 Waiver.\nOur failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof.<\/p>\n<p>21.4 Severability.\nThe invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>21.5

or service (collectively, the “Services”) of Couchsurfing International, Inc.\n(“Couchsurfing,” “we” or “us”).\nIf you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion.\nIf Couchsurfing makes changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, including by revising the date at the top of these Terms.\nYour continued use of our Services following the posting of changes or modifications will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.\nAccordingly, you should frequently review these Terms and applicable policies and guidelines to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how Couchsurfing collects, uses and discloses information about our members.\nIn addition, by accessing or using our Services, you agree to adhere to the Community Guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>Please Contact Us with any questions regarding these Terms.\nYou can contact us by

94104-5401 US<\/p>\n<p>or by email at support@couchsurfing.com<\/p> 1.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT <p>You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services.\nBy registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site.\nIf you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or service.\nBy registering for an account, you further agree to (a) provide accurate, truthful, current and complete information.\n(b) maintain and promptly update your account information upon any changes.\n(c) maintain the security of your account by protecting your password and restricting access to your account.\n(d) promptly notify Couchsurfing if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Services.\nand (e) take responsibility for all activities that occur under your account and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access.<\/p> 2.\nTHIRD

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services, Member Content that we believe, in our sole discretion:<\/p>\n<p>(a) is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, or that would otherwise create

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other members from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the

of our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(f) collect or store any information about any other member other than as permitted on our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(g) use our Services for any commercial purpose whatsoever,

relating to use of the Services;<\/p>\n<p>(k) hold yourself out as an agent, representative, employee or affiliate of Couchsurfing, including but not limited to when you host an event for other

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such Member Content in any form, in all media now known or hereinafter created (including in emails or other communications to our members) to administer, operate, develop and otherwise provide the

of contribution plans, including special promotional plans or contributions offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services.\nWe are not responsible for

to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Contribution Method.\nFor some Contribution Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Contribution Method.\nCheck with your Contribution Method service provider for details.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Updating your Contribution Methods.<\/strong> You can

for Couchsurfing using your account with a third party, such as Paypal, as a Contribution Method and wish to cancel your Couchsurfing contributions, you may need to do so through that third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or cancelling your contributions to the Couchsurfing service through that third party.\nYou may also find contribution information about your Couchsurfing contributions by visiting your account with the applicable third party.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes to the Price and Contributions Plans.<\/strong> We reserve the right to change our contribution plans or adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes or changes to your contribution plan will take effect following notice to you.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>No

SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF SECTIONS 16 AND 17 MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<\/p>\n<p>17.5 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS EXCLUDES OR LIMITS OUR LIABILITY FOR

and we are not obligated to take any action.<\/p> 20.\nDISPUTES.\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH COUCHSURFING AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Services, except that you and Couchsurfing are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.\nSUBJECT TO ANY RIGHTS

(30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California and that arbitration will be

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

technology;<\/p>\n<p>(j) may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party.\nBy posting Member Content, you represent and warrant that you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other members from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the

of our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(f) collect or store any information about any other member other than as permitted on our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(g) use our Services for any commercial purpose whatsoever, unless with prior written consent from Couchsurfing;<\/p>\n<p>(h) register for more than one member account;<\/p>\n<p>(i) impersonate any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent

relating to use of the Services;<\/p>\n<p>(k) hold yourself out as an agent, representative, employee or affiliate of Couchsurfing, including but not limited to when you host an event for other

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms

our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member

third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or

content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our

contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms

94104-5401 US<\/p>\n<p>or by email at support@couchsurfing.com<\/p> 1.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT <p>You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services.\nBy registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any

relating to use of the Services;<\/p>\n<p>(k) hold yourself out as an agent, representative, employee or affiliate of Couchsurfing, including but not limited to when you host an event for other

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion.\nIf Couchsurfing makes

94104-5401 US<\/p>\n<p>or by email at support@couchsurfing.com<\/p> 1.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT <p>You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services.\nBy registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site.\nIf you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or

content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

DOLLARS ($100).<\/p>\n<p>17.4.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.\nACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF SECTIONS 16 AND 17 MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<\/p>\n<p>17.5 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS EXCLUDES OR LIMITS OUR LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY OUR NEGLIGENCE OR FOR FRAUD.<\/p> 18.\nINDEMNITY\n<p>You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Couchsurfing (and each of our officers, directors, members,

and we are not obligated to take any action.<\/p> 20.\nDISPUTES.\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH COUCHSURFING AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Services, except that you and Couchsurfing are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.\nSUBJECT TO ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\nYou and Couchsurfing also agree that the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.\nOther than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nWHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND COUCHSURFING WILL

matter.<\/p>\n<p>21.3 Waiver.\nOur failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof.<\/p>\n<p>21.4 Severability.\nThe invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>21.5

or service (collectively, the “Services”) of Couchsurfing International, Inc.\n(“Couchsurfing,” “we” or “us”).\nIf you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion.\nIf Couchsurfing makes changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, including by revising the date at the top of these Terms.\nYour continued use of our Services following the posting of changes or modifications will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.\nAccordingly, you should frequently review these Terms and applicable policies and guidelines to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how Couchsurfing collects, uses and discloses information about our members.\nIn addition, by accessing or using our Services, you agree to adhere to the Community Guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>Please Contact Us with any questions regarding these Terms.\nYou can contact us by mail at Couchsurfing International, Inc.\nAttention: Couchsurfing International, Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Attn: Legal Department<\/p>\n<p>548 Market St<\/p>\n<p>PMB 86600<\/p>\n<p>San Francisco, California 94104-5401 US<\/p>\n<p>or by email at support@couchsurfing.com<\/p> 1.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT <p>You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services.\nBy registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site.\nIf you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or service.\nBy registering for an account, you further agree to (a) provide accurate, truthful, current and complete information.\n(b) maintain and promptly update your account information upon any changes.\n(c) maintain the security of your account by protecting your password and restricting access to your account.\n(d) promptly notify Couchsurfing if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to the Services.\nand (e) take responsibility for all activities that occur under your account and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access.<\/p> 2.\nTHIRD PARTY TERMS <p>Couchsurfing may offer the opportunity to purchase products and services from third parties.\nYou acknowledge that such products and services are offered and sold to you by one or more third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services, Member Content that we believe, in our sole discretion:<\/p>\n<p>(a) is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or international law;<\/p>\n<p>(b) contains nudity, sexually explicit content or is otherwise obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive or

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other members from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the

of our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(f) collect or store any information about any other member other than as permitted on our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(g) use our Services for any commercial purpose whatsoever,

relating to use of the Services;<\/p>\n<p>(k) hold yourself out as an agent, representative, employee or affiliate of Couchsurfing, including but not limited to when you host an event for other

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such Member Content in any form, in all media now known or hereinafter created (including in emails or other communications to our members) to administer, operate, develop and otherwise provide the

of contribution plans, including special promotional plans or contributions offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services.\nWe are not responsible for

for any uncollected amounts.\nIf a contribution is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your contributions, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Contribution Method.\nFor some Contribution Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Contribution Method.\nCheck with your Contribution Method service provider for details.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Updating your Contribution Methods.<\/strong> You can

for Couchsurfing using your account with a third party, such as Paypal, as a Contribution Method and wish to cancel your Couchsurfing contributions, you may need to do so through that third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or cancelling your contributions to the Couchsurfing service through that third party.\nYou may also find

amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.\nThe provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.\n<\/p> 15.\nMEMBER’S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES <p>15.1.\nYou hereby represent and warrant that

and we are not obligated to take any action.<\/p> 20.\nDISPUTES.\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH COUCHSURFING AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Services, except that you and Couchsurfing are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.\nSUBJECT TO ANY RIGHTS

(30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\nYou and Couchsurfing also agree that the state or federal courts in San Francisco

discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nWHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND COUCHSURFING WILL

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion.\nIf Couchsurfing makes

our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other members from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the

of our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(f) collect or store any information about any other member other than as permitted on our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(g) use our Services for any commercial purpose whatsoever, unless with prior written consent from Couchsurfing;<\/p>\n<p>(h) register for more than one member account;<\/p>\n<p>(i) impersonate any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent

relating to use of the Services;<\/p>\n<p>(k) hold yourself out as an agent, representative, employee or affiliate of Couchsurfing, including but not limited to when you host an event for other

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member

contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal

94104-5401 US<\/p>\n<p>or by email at support@couchsurfing.com<\/p> 1.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT <p>You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services.\nBy registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

and we are not obligated to take any action.<\/p> 20.\nDISPUTES.\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH COUCHSURFING AND IT LIMITS THE

arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.\nSUBJECT TO ANY RIGHTS

unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>21.5

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion.\nIf Couchsurfing makes

our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site.\nIf you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or

content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member

content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal

and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how Couchsurfing collects, uses and discloses information about our members.\nIn addition, by accessing or using our Services, you agree to adhere to the Community Guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>Please Contact Us with any questions regarding these Terms.\nYou can contact us by

94104-5401 US<\/p>\n<p>or by email at support@couchsurfing.com<\/p> 1.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT <p>You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services.\nBy registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site.\nIf you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or

security breaches related to the Services.\nand (e) take responsibility for all activities that occur under your account and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access.<\/p> 2.\nTHIRD PARTY TERMS <p>Couchsurfing may offer the opportunity to purchase products and services from third parties.\nYou acknowledge that such products and services are offered and sold to you by one or more third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other members from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the

of our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(f) collect or store any information about any other member other than as permitted on our Services;<\/p>\n<p>(g) use our Services for any commercial purpose whatsoever, unless with prior written consent from Couchsurfing;<\/p>\n<p>(h) register for more than one member account;<\/p>\n<p>(i) impersonate any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent

relating to use of the Services;<\/p>\n<p>(k) hold yourself out as an agent, representative, employee or affiliate of Couchsurfing, including but not limited to when you host an event for other

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

of contribution plans, including special promotional plans or contributions offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services.\nWe are not responsible for

charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Contribution Method on the next contribution date indicated on \"Membership &amp.\nContributions\" on the \"Account &amp.\nSettings\" page.\nThe length of your contribution cycle will depend on the type of contribution plan that you choose when you sign-up for as a member of Couchsurfing.\nContributions are fully earned upon payment.\nIn some cases your contribution date may change, for example if your Contribution Method has not successfully settled or if your membership began on a day not contained in a given month.\nVisit our website and go to \"Membership &amp.\nContributions\" on the \"Account &amp.\nSettings\" page to see your next contribution date.\nWe may authorize your Contribution Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contribution Methods.<\/strong> To use the Couchsurfing service you must provide one or more Contribution Methods.\nYou authorize us to charge any Contribution Method associated to your account in case your primary Contribution Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your membership contribution.\nYou remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.\nIf a contribution is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your contributions, we may suspend your access

CONTROL.<\/p>\n<p>17.3.\nIN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY IN ANY MATTER ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO OUR SERVICES OR THESE TERMS EXCEED THE SUM OF ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS ($100).<\/p>\n<p>17.4.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.\nACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF SECTIONS 16 AND 17 MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<\/p>\n<p>17.5 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS EXCLUDES OR LIMITS OUR LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY OUR NEGLIGENCE OR FOR FRAUD.<\/p> 18.\nINDEMNITY\n<p>You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Couchsurfing (and each of our officers, directors, members,

our Services.\n(b) any Member Content or Submissions you provide.\n(c) your violation of these Terms.\n(d) your violation of any rights of another.\nor (e) your conduct in connection with the Services.\nFurther, if you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that such entity agrees to indemnify you and Couchsurfing for violations of these Terms in

and we are not obligated to take any action.<\/p> 20.\nDISPUTES.\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH COUCHSURFING AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Services, except that you and Couchsurfing are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.\nSUBJECT TO ANY RIGHTS

County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.\nOther than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nWHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND COUCHSURFING WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.<\/p> 21.\nMISCELLANEOUS.\n<p>21.1 Assignment.\nYou may not assign any of your rights or

or approval.<\/p>\n<p>21.2 Entire Agreement.\nThese Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, between the parties regarding their subject matter.<\/p>\n<p>21.3 Waiver.\nOur failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof.<\/p>\n<p>21.4 Severability.\nThe invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>21.5

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion.\nIf Couchsurfing makes changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, including by revising the date at the top of these Terms.\nYour continued use of our Services following the posting of changes or

and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how Couchsurfing collects, uses and discloses information about our members.\nIn addition, by accessing or using our Services, you agree to adhere to the Community Guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>Please Contact Us with any questions regarding these Terms.\nYou can contact us by

our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site.\nIf you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.\nSUBJECT TO ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal

our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site.\nIf you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other members from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

before they renew in order to avoid contributing your Couchsurfing contribution for the next contribution cycle to your Contribution Method (see \"Cancellation\" below).<\/p>\n<p>We may offer a number of contribution plans, including special promotional plans or contributions offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nSome membership contribution plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you.\nYou can find specific details regarding your Couchsurfing membership by logging into your account and navigating to \"Membership &amp.\nContributions\" on the

\"Membership &amp.\nContributions\" on the \"Account &amp.\nSettings\" page.\nThe length of your contribution cycle will depend on the type of contribution plan that you choose when you sign-up for as a member of Couchsurfing.\nContributions are fully earned upon payment.\nIn some cases your contribution date may change, for example if your Contribution Method has not successfully settled or if your membership began on a day not contained in a given month.\nVisit our website and go to \"Membership &amp.\nContributions\" on the \"Account &amp.\nSettings\" page to see your next contribution date.\nWe may authorize your Contribution Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contribution Methods.<\/strong> To use the Couchsurfing service you must provide one or more Contribution Methods.\nYou authorize us to charge any Contribution Method associated to your account in case your primary Contribution Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your membership contribution.\nYou remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.\nIf a contribution is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your contributions, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Contribution Method.\nFor some Contribution Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Contribution Method.\nCheck with your Contribution Method service provider for details.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Updating your Contribution Methods.<\/strong> You can update your Contribution Methods by contacting our Support Team.\nWe may also update your Contribution Methods using information provided by the payment service providers.\nFollowing any update, you

until the end of your current contribution period.\nTo see when your contribution period expires, go to \"Membership &amp.\nContributions\" on the \"Account &amp.\nSettings\" page.\nIf you signed up for Couchsurfing using your account with a third party, such as Paypal, as a Contribution Method and wish to cancel your Couchsurfing contributions, you may need to do so through that third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or cancelling your contributions to the Couchsurfing service through that third party.\nYou may also find contribution information about your Couchsurfing contributions by visiting your account with the applicable third party.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes to the Price and Contributions Plans.<\/strong> We reserve the right to change our contribution plans or adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes or changes to your contribution plan will take effect following notice to you.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<strong>No

through the end of your current contribution period.\nAt any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (\"credits\").\nThe amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.\nThe provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.\n<\/p> 15.\nMEMBER’S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES <p>15.1.\nYou hereby represent and warrant that

DOLLARS ($100).<\/p>\n<p>17.4.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.\nACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF SECTIONS 16 AND 17 MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<\/p>\n<p>17.5 NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS EXCLUDES OR LIMITS OUR LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY OUR NEGLIGENCE OR FOR FRAUD.<\/p> 18.\nINDEMNITY\n<p>You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Couchsurfing (and each of our officers, directors, members,

accordance with this Section.\nIf you are obligated to indemnify us, we will have the right, in our sole and unfettered discretion, to control any action or proceeding and determine whether we wish to settle it, and if so, on what terms.<\/p> 19.\nREPORTING MISCONDUCT\n<p>If you interact with anyone through our Services who you feel is acting or has acted inappropriately, including but not limited to offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, who steals from you or engages in any other disturbing conduct, we strongly encourage you to immediately report such person to the appropriate

and we are not obligated to take any action.<\/p> 20.\nDISPUTES.\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH COUCHSURFING AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Services, except that you and Couchsurfing are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.\nSUBJECT TO ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\nYou and Couchsurfing also agree that the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.\nOther than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nWHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND COUCHSURFING WILL

unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>21.5

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion.\nIf Couchsurfing makes

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such Member Content in any form, in all media now known or hereinafter created (including in emails or other communications to our members) to administer, operate, develop and otherwise provide the Couchsurfing Services.\nYou represent and warrant that (a) you own and control all of the rights to the Member Content that you post or you otherwise have the right to post such Member Content to the Services.\n(b) the Member Content is accurate and not misleading.\nand (c) the use and posting of the Member Content you supply does not violate these Terms and will not violate any rights of or cause

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms

our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member

contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms

94104-5401 US<\/p>\n<p>or by email at support@couchsurfing.com<\/p> 1.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT <p>You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services.\nBy registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely

third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or

content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Couchsurfing proves that it is not responsible for the event that allowed the damage to occur.<\/p> Social Media Tools <p>Couchsurfing may offer social sharing features or other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that

Google from time to time.<\/p> Third Party Links <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services as part of our Services.\nThese third parties may have

on pages, links clicked and conversion information.\nThis information may be used by Couchsurfing and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nPlease note that we may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in a hashed, non-human readable form, with these third parties.\nFor example, we may engage a third party data provider who may collect web log data from you or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content.\nThese cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to information you voluntarily provide to us (e.g., an email address) in a hashed, non-human readable form.\nFor more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices.<\/p> How Do We Protect Visitor Information? <p>We take security of your data seriously and take reasonable

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion.\nIf Couchsurfing makes

94104-5401 US<\/p>\n<p>or by email at support@couchsurfing.com<\/p> 1.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT <p>You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services.\nBy registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or anyone else and we may, in our sole discretion, edit, remove or delete any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the Community Guidelines.\nIn addition, you agree not to:<\/p>\n<p>(a) use the Services in violation of any applicable law or regulation, including promoting or encouraging any illegal activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other members from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or

content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other members from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the

is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal penalties.<\/p>\n<p>We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms, or any policy or guideline of our Services, at any time and in our sole discretion.\nIf Couchsurfing makes

modifications will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.\nAccordingly, you should frequently review these Terms and applicable policies and guidelines to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how Couchsurfing collects, uses and discloses information about our members.\nIn addition, by accessing or using our Services, you agree to adhere to the Community Guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>Please Contact Us with any questions regarding these Terms.\nYou can contact us by

94104-5401 US<\/p>\n<p>or by email at support@couchsurfing.com<\/p> 1.\nELIGIBILITY, REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT <p>You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Services.\nBy registering to use our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site.\nIf you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or

content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such

our Services.\n(b) any Member Content or Submissions you provide.\n(c) your violation of these Terms.\n(d) your violation of any rights of another.\nor (e) your conduct in connection with the Services.\nFurther, if you are using the Services on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that such entity agrees to indemnify you and Couchsurfing for violations of these Terms in

settle it, and if so, on what terms.<\/p> 19.\nREPORTING MISCONDUCT\n<p>If you interact with anyone through our Services who you feel is acting or has acted inappropriately, including but not limited to offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, who steals from you or engages in any other disturbing conduct, we strongly encourage you to immediately report such person to the appropriate

and we are not obligated to take any action.<\/p> 20.\nDISPUTES.\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH COUCHSURFING AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Services, except that you and Couchsurfing are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.\nSUBJECT TO ANY RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.\nYou and Couchsurfing agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\nYou and Couchsurfing also agree that the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.\nOther than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nWHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND COUCHSURFING WILL

or approval.<\/p>\n<p>21.2 Entire Agreement.\nThese Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, between the parties regarding their subject matter.<\/p>\n<p>21.3 Waiver.\nOur failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof.<\/p>\n<p>21.4 Severability.\nThe invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.<\/p>\n<p>21.5 Headings.\nHeadings of sections are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit or construe such sections.<\/p>\n<p>21.7 Survival.\nSections 3.5 (Release), 4 (Member Conduct and Content), 5

you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity will be responsible for your violation of these Terms.\nFailure to use our Services in accordance with these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services and may subject you to legal action by Couchsurfing and/or severe civil and/or criminal

our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old.\nIn order to access certain areas and features of our Services, you will need to register for an account using either your email address or your login credentials from a third-party social media site.\nIf you register with your email address, you agree to create a unique password that you do not use with any other online product or

third parties.\nFor more information, please refer to the applicable third party’s terms of sale and privacy policy that are presented as part of the checkout process.<\/p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.<\/p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member’s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing’s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member’s identity or good faith.<\/p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.<\/p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<\/p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, “Member Content”).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or transmit via our Services.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services,

you have the lawful right to distribute and reproduce such Member Content.\nor<\/p>\n<p>(k) would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense or violate the rights of any third party.\nCouchsurfing is not responsible for any Member Content that you or other members post, transmit or store through the Services.\nWe have no obligation to post Member Content from you or

content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.<\/p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the

activity;<\/p>\n<p>(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity or contractual rights;<\/p>\n<p>(c) use the Services in any

Content that you post to our Services.\nIf you post Member Content to our Services, you hereby grant us a perpetual (i.e.\nlasting forever), worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sublicensable (i.e.\nwe can grant this right to others) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, adapt, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, have distributed and promote such
